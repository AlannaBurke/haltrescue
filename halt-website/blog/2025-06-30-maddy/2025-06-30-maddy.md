Some optimistic news about Maddy! 💛

<!-- truncate -->

The tumor in her ear isn’t too deep into the canal, and our vet is very hopeful about the outcome of surgical removal.

We actually did an ultrasound of her ear—which I’ve never done before—and it was pretty cool to see! That sort of oblong shape on the screen is the tumor. I got a photo of that view, though I missed the one showing the ear canal itself.

Maddy is scheduled for surgery on July 10th, with an estimated cost of $406.
I decided against scheduling it right before the holiday weekend—just in case there were complications, I wanted to ensure full access to post-op care.

I do have a full cost breakdown in the rescue room, but I’m going to be honest—I feel like hot garbage right now. I’m going to rest a bit, watch the ballgame, and maybe doze off for half an hour before jumping back into everything.

In the meantime, we urgently need help covering:
 - Today’s appointment for five piggies, which came to over $300
 - Maddy’s upcoming surgery, quoted at $400+
