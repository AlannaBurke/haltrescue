Hero is back to his popcorning self, and Parody is thriving—he no longer needs to be hand-fed. He’s eating, drinking, and his output is great. The only odd thing is that his stomach makes the wildest noises, which we suspect may be related to the mass in his abdomen.

We also have a very interesting update about Novel. Since arriving, he hadn’t been drinking on his own, so he’s been getting sub-q fluids 1–3 times a day. A few days ago, while I was feeding him on a white blanket, he peed—and it was quite pink! He was immediately started on antibiotics and is already feeling so much better. I even caught him nibbling on some pellets and hay!

This poor pig has been hiding so many health issues, but we’re tackling them one by one—and slowly seeing a much happier piggie emerge. It’s been a slow process, but I’m so glad I didn’t give up on him
