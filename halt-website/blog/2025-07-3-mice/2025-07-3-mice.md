I got a little busy yesterday… and then went home and fell asleep 😅—so I never got around to introducing our newest intake.

<!-- truncate -->

It is… more mice! 🐭

Because honestly, what’s two more mice at this point?

These adorable little ladies have just arrived and are settling in well—but they come with a not-so-great backstory.

We saw them posted in a rehoming group and reached out immediately. The person who ended up with them hadn’t intended to adopt mice—her son had discovered that his coworker was keeping them in his car in 90° heat. The mice were in a cage with a frozen water bottle, but it was dangerously hot and completely unsafe.

Knowing they wouldn’t survive those conditions, her son offered to take them, and the coworker agreed.

While the family wanted to make sure the mice went to a safe, loving home, they felt overwhelmed about how to screen potential adopters—so they reached out to us. And of course, we said yes!

We’re happy to have these two sweet girls with us now—and they are definitely enjoying the air conditioning. ❄️

The little orange girl is a bit braver than her sister, but we’re confident they’ll both come out of their shells in no time.

And of course… I had to give them slightly strange names because would it really be me if I didn’t? 🥴
So please meet:

🥯 Bagel Sandwich (orange girl)
🧀 Cream Cheese (white/orange girl)
