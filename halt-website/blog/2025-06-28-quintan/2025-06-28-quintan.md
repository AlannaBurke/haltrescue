title: A Sad Update on Quintan

Quintan passed peacefully over the rainbow bridge.
He drifted off quietly while snuggled up against me.

<!-- truncate -->

I hate that he’s gone—he was such a darling pig with a huge personality. But if an animal has to pass, I always hope it’s peaceful and quick, and I’m grateful that’s how it happened for him.

He will be deeply missed by me and by Team Wonkiest Boys.
Popcorn free, my little friend. 💛
