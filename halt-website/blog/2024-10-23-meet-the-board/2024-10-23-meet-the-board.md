Fun fact: Danni was terrified of guinea pigs when she was a child! Danni currently runs the sanctuary from her home in New Hampshire. She houses senior, hospice, and special needs small animals and gives them all the care they need to live a normal, happy life. She also manages our foster team which are based in NJ, PA, NY and DE..

Ericka has been involved in animal rescue since 2000 when two little feral kittens entered her life unexpectedly. Their intro initiated 24 years of devoted loving work in rescue. Ericka started rescuing small animals about 14 years ago when she became heavily involved in HALT.

She now provides sanctuary to two hedgehogs and six chinchillas while supporting the rescue in other ways. Ericka heads up the arts and crafts division while collecting items for and running auctions. Her primary focus now is to collaborate with others on raising funds that help cover medical care and provide rich and fulfilling lives for the animals in the rescueâ€™s care. Ericka shares her house with the chinchillas, hedgies and with four lovely kitties who she is devoted to entirely.
