You've probably noticed that social media, especially Facebook, has been frustrating lately - it's hard to see the content you're looking for. This has a really negative effect on non-profits who depend on reaching their audience on social media! We've put together a list of ways you can help us and ensure you and others see our content. 

<!-- truncate -->

Facebook and other platforms don’t always show you everything from the pages you follow. Here’s how you can make sure you don’t miss updates from us — and help us reach more people:

### Facebook

1. Follow our Page – click the Follow button if you haven’t already. If you "liked" our page many years ago, check and make sure that's been updated to "following," which has now taken the place of "like."
2. Add us to Favorites – tap the “Following” dropdown and select Favorites. This tells Facebook to show you our posts higher in your feed.
3. Engage with our posts – every like, comment, share, or click signals to Facebook that people want to see more of our content. The love, care, and wow reactions seem to help the most. And don't worry about making a clever comment - just comment 4 or more words! "Wow, they're so cute!" will do.

### Why This Matters

Social media platforms show our posts to more people when you interact with them. Following, favoriting, liking, sharing, or even leaving a quick emoji comment makes a big difference.

It’s a free and easy way to support our work and make sure the animals in our care get seen and supported.
