Alanna has officially welcomed Ziggy—Hero’s “normal” brother—into her home!

<!-- truncate -->

He had just reached the age where I was about to list him on Petfinder… but Alanna snatched him up before anyone else had the chance. 😄

Ziggy will be living the good life with two HALT alumni boys, and let’s be honest—he’s going to be extra spoiled. And since Alanna and I talk every day, I fully expect to receive daily photo updates. 😉

We’re so excited for this little guy and so grateful he’s staying close to the HALT family! 💛
