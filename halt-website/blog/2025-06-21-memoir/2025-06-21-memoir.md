# A Difficult Update About Memoir

With heavy hearts, we’ve made the decision to bring Memoir in for humane euthanasia today. She’s no longer able to swallow even water, and while we had hoped to wait for our regular vet on Monday, it simply wouldn’t be fair to make her wait and suffer. 💔

<!-- truncate -->

Since this is a last-minute Saturday appointment, there is an emergency fee involved. If you’re able to contribute, we would be incredibly grateful for any donations to help cover the cost of helping Memoir cross the rainbow bridge peacefully.

Thank you, as always, for your compassion and support. 💛
