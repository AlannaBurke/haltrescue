Our first surrender of the day is a trio of chinchillas—how cute are these ladies?! 😻

<!-- truncate -->

They also come with one of the funnier surrender stories we’ve heard in a while…

The person who surrendered them wasn’t actually expecting to have chinchillas at all. Her significant other is a contractor and was doing work in someone’s home. As he was leaving, the homeowner asked, “Do you want a chinchilla?”

He—being a perfectly reasonable person—replied, “No, I don’t know anything about chinchillas!”

But she persisted.
“How about you take all three?”
So… off he went, with three chinchillas in tow. 😂

His partner was amused, but understandably overwhelmed. She explained that she had no experience with chinchillas and didn’t feel equipped to care for three surprise floofs. They genuinely wanted the best for the girls and reached out to us—and of course, we said yes!

All three are girls (yay!) and one of them is especially adorable and… a little extra round—she’s practically rolling. 😂 We’ll make sure she gets on a healthy track, and they’ll all receive the care, space, and one-on-one attention they deserve.

Even better? They’ll be living permanently with one of our amazing board members! 💖
