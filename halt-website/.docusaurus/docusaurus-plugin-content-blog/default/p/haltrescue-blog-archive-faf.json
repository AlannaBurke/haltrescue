Meanwhile, The Pipsqueakery will continue their outstanding work with wildlife and domestic rescue, a mission we fully support and admire.\n\nWe’re proud to announce that Helping All Little Things is officially established as a 501(c)(3) organization in New Hampshire and we will continue to do rescue work along the East Coast.\n\nYou can still find us on the same social media platforms, and we hope you’ll continue to follow us and support our work as we embark on this new chapter.\n\nThank you for being a part of our journey — we couldn’t do it without you, and we’re excited for all the great things to come!\n\n### Follow us on:\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/HALPRescue/)    \n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/halfrescue)    \n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/halfrescue/)    \n[Mastodon](https://mstdn.social/@haltrescue)    \n\n\n### Support us with:\n\n[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/8SJFNZQVMQ452)    \n[Venmo](https://account.venmo.com/u/haltrescue)    \n[CashApp](https://cash.app/$Haltrescue)    \n[Amazon Wish List](https://bit.ly/halt-piggies)"}]}}
