# Transparency Is Not Optional — It’s Foundational

In rescue, transparency isn’t a nice-to-have — it’s essential.

When you’re responsible for the care, treatment, and often the survival of animals, you’re also accountable to the community that supports you. Whether it’s donors, fosters, adopters, volunteers, or fellow rescuers, people deserve to know what’s going on.

That doesn’t mean putting every vet bill online or live-tweeting every medication dose. But it does mean being honest, clear, and professional when people ask questions — even hard ones.

## It’s Okay to Ask

If you’ve ever felt weird about asking a rescue where funds are going, what the outcome was for a certain animal, or why they made a specific choice — we’re here to say: it’s okay to ask.

Good rescues will answer you. They won’t delete your comment, ban you, or shut down the conversation. They’ll welcome the chance to clarify.

Why? Because transparency builds trust. It’s how we show you that we’re doing what we say we’re doing — even when things are messy, complicated, or imperfect (which they often are in rescue work).

So if something seems off, or if you’re just genuinely curious — ask. Respectfully, sure. But don’t be afraid to speak up.

##  For Rescues: Transparency Is Your Obligation

If you’re running a rescue, transparency isn’t just about being nice — in many cases, it’s a legal requirement, especially if you’re a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.

Here’s what ethical transparency can look like:
- Being open about where donations go (without violating privacy or dignity)
- Disclosing outcomes, even when they’re hard (e.g., humane euthanasia, failed treatments)
- Sharing policies about intake, adoption, and medical decisions
- Responding to questions with professionalism — not defensiveness

You don’t need to share everything. But you do need to share the things that matter: finances, animal outcomes, and your guiding values.

And if something went wrong? Say so. Be honest. People don’t expect perfection — they expect integrity.

##  Secrecy Enables Harm

Here’s the hard truth: the worst outcomes in rescue happen when no one is watching.

Hoarding cases, severe neglect, and overwhelmed rescuers don’t usually happen in the spotlight. They happen quietly, behind closed doors, because people are afraid to ask questions — or afraid to answer them.

Transparency is how we protect animals before it’s too late. It’s how we identify when someone’s struggling, when a rescue is in over their head, or when practices are crossing a line.

So if something feels off to you, ask. If the answer makes you feel worse — tell someone. Offer help. Alert a partner rescue. Reach out to animal control. Advocate for the animals. We would rather get an unnecessary inspection than have a preventable tragedy happen in silence.

Rescue is hard, and it takes a village. Let’s make sure that village includes oversight.

## Let’s Normalize Transparency

The more we all normalize asking questions — and answering them well — the more we raise the bar for animal welfare overall. We teach new rescuers how to do better. We educate the public on what ethical, sustainable rescue looks like. And most importantly, we make sure that the animals always come first.

Transparency isn’t weakness — it’s strength. And in a space as emotionally charged and vital as animal rescue, it’s also an act of respect.
