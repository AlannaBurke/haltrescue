# Why Budgeting is Important

When people imagine running an animal rescue, they picture cuddles, cute faces, and happy adoptions. What they don’t always see is the spreadsheet behind the scenes.

Rescue work is deeply emotional—but it’s also logistical. The reality is, if you’re not budgeting well, animals can suffer. That’s not just inconvenient—it’s unethical.

## Why Budgeting is a Rescue Essential

Emergencies don’t make appointments. A midnight trip to the ER for a guinea pig with bloat, a rabbit needing x-rays on a Sunday, or a sudden need to say goodbye—these are the kinds of moments every rescue will face. And those moments come with a cost.

That’s why every responsible rescue should have:
 - 💡 Emergency funds on hand for urgent care, diagnostics, or humane euthanasia
 - 📦 Essential supplies stocked: medications, syringes, recovery food, wound care materials
 - 📆 Planned vet expenses, including routine checkups, dental work, and follow-ups
 - 💵 Wiggle room in the budget—because things will go sideways

This isn’t just about being prepared. It’s about doing right by the animals. When someone entrusts a life to you—whether it’s a healthy surrender or a critical case—you need to be able to act without hesitation.

## Your Priority is the Animals Under Your Care

We know as well as anyone that the number of animals who need to be surrendered or pulled from the shelter is never-ending. But when it comes to care, your priority must always be the animals already under your care. It is never acceptable to deny or delay care to an animal you have already taken custody of in order to take in more animals. There will always be more animals, and there will always be guilt and both internal and external pressure to take more. Focus on the animals you already have, and if you want to take more, sit down and take an honest look at your current resources.

## It’s Not Just Cages and Hay

Running a rescue involves:
 - Careful tracking of expenses and income
 - Forecasting for upcoming intakes or known medical issues
 - Navigating fluctuating donation patterns (especially during “slow” months)
 - Being transparent and accountable to your community

We believe strongly that rescue is more than just love—it’s a commitment to sustainable care. That means saying no when you’re not ready, prioritizing medical needs, and planning ahead.

## Have a Doomsday Strategy: Planning for the Unthinkable

Every rescue should operate with compassion, but also with caution—and that includes preparing for the worst-case scenario. Whether you call it a contingency plan or a doomsday strategy, the principle is the same: what will you do if all your income dries up?

Imagine this:

Grants fall through. Donations stop. Your vet bills are climbing. Your credit cards are maxed. Your volunteers are stretched thin. The animals still need care—every single day. What then?

If you haven’t planned for this possibility, the animals (and you) may pay the price.

What a Doomsday Plan Should Include
 - A Minimum Operating Budget: Know the bare minimum it takes to feed, medicate, and house your animals for 30, 60, and 90 days.
 - A Tiered Exit Strategy: Which animals could be transferred to trusted rescues? Which fosters could keep their animals if needed? What’s your plan if you need to close intake?
 - Emergency Funds Access: A savings account, emergency line of credit, or personal backup fund (not ideal, but common).
 - Pre-drafted Communications: Have templates ready to transparently communicate a pause in operations, a fundraising emergency, or a temporary shutdown to your followers and supporters.
 - Euthanasia Considerations: It’s heartbreaking, but part of ethical rescue is ensuring that no animal suffers due to lack of resources. If you cannot provide care, do you have a humane plan?

## Why It Matters

Being prepared doesn’t mean being pessimistic—it means you’re serious about responsibility. Running a rescue is more than saving lives in the moment. It’s about ensuring quality of life long-term. That means having a plan, even if it’s one you hope you’ll never have to use.

When you have that plan in place, you also have more peace of mind. You know that even if the worst happens, you won’t be left scrambling—and more importantly, the animals won’t be left behind.

## What’s Next

We’re pulling back the curtain and sharing some of the lesser-discussed parts of rescue life—from budgeting and admin, to burnout and boundaries. Because the truth is, many of us didn’t just learn how to care for animals—we learned how to run an organization.

Whether you’re thinking of starting a rescue, already involved, or just curious about what goes on behind the scenes—this is for you.

As always, thank you for being part of this community. Your support makes it possible for us to plan and act when animals need us most. 💖
