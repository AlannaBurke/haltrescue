# Rescue and Veterinary Care: What You Owe the Animals

When you run a rescue, you take on a lot — shelter, food, enrichment, cleaning, and of course… medical care. And let’s be real: a lot of that falls to us. We clean wounds, administer medications, track symptoms, manage chronic conditions, and make hard decisions.

But here’s the line we must never cross:

_You cannot and should not operate without a vet._

This isn’t just a legal technicality — it’s an ethical obligation. 

<!-- truncate -->

When you run a rescue, you must have a licensed veterinarian involved in the care of your animals. That doesn’t mean you need to rush to the office for every sneeze — we do a lot of triaging and supportive care ourselves – but it does mean you need an established relationship with a vet who understands what you do, what animals you work with, and what you’re capable of handling on-site.

Many of us are trained by our vets to handle minor issues at home so we’re not clogging up emergency lines for every crusty nose. But there’s a clear line: you are not a vet. You cannot legally diagnose or treat medical conditions without veterinary oversight.

Every animal in your care deserves to be seen — and properly diagnosed — by a vet. For unusual symptoms or ongoing conditions, that also means being willing to ask for more.

## Second Opinions Are Always Okay

In rescue, we deal with a lot of edge cases — rare illnesses, neglected animals, exotic species. It’s okay if your vet doesn’t have all the answers right away.

 - It’s always okay to:
 - Ask for a second opinion
R - equest a referral to a specialist
 - Seek out a clinic with more experience in exotics or specific conditions

If your current vet isn’t open to learning, doesn’t stay up to date on new care practices, or is stuck in outdated thinking — it’s also okay to find a new one. Your first obligation is to your animals, and that sometimes means finding the right team to support them.

## Diagnosis Is Not a DIY Job

Yes, we treat a lot in-house — but we do it because we’ve been taught to. Our vets walk us through care plans. We check in with them. We monitor progress and report back.

It’s one thing to administer meds you’ve been prescribed for a known condition. It’s another to self-diagnose a new case and start treatment without veterinary input. That’s practicing medicine without a license, and it puts animals at risk — even if you think you know what’s going on.

If you’re working with exotics, this goes double. Research is evolving constantly. Treatments shift. Diagnostic tools improve. It’s on us to stay current — reading papers, attending seminars, talking with other rescues, and sharing findings with our vets.

Just like our vets are required to do continuing education, we have an obligation to do the same if we’re working in this space.

## Build the Relationship — And Respect It

### Respect Goes Both Ways

That said, don’t take advantage of your vets. Many of them:

 - Offer us discounts
 - Prioritize our appointments
 - Trust our judgment with animal handling and treatment

If you’ve done this work long enough, you know how special a good vet is. The ones who take your panicked calls, who squeeze in emergency appointments, who trust your instincts and cut you breaks when you’re drowning.

We owe them the same respect. Don’t call at 2AM unless it’s truly an emergency. Don’t assume they’ll comp your bill or “hook up” your friend. Don’t push boundaries because you think you’re an exception. Trust and mutual respect are what make a strong rescue-vet relationship work — and last.

- Don’t call at 2 AM unless it’s a real emergency.
- Don’t assume you’ll get a discount — even if you have before.
- Don’t send your friends to “your” vet expecting a hookup.

The minute you start to expect special treatment is the moment you’re crossing a line.

Your vet might be generous. They might be supportive. They might even be a close friend. But at the end of the day, they are running a business — and they are also likely burning out under the weight of cases, compassion fatigue, and emotional labor. Respect their time, their boundaries, and their expertise.

## Be Smart, Be Skilled, Be Accountable

We all start somewhere. No one expects new rescuers to have a medical degree. But they should expect you to learn, ask, document, and collaborate.

If you don’t have a vet yet — find one. If your vet won’t support your rescue — find one who will. If your current practices are a little too casual with medications or diagnoses — clean that up.

The animals depend on us not just for food and safety, but for competent, appropriate, and ethical medical care. And that means working with our vets — not trying to replace them.

## Medical Advances in Rescue: Don’t Write Them Off Yet

One of the most powerful tools a rescuer can have is up-to-date medical knowledge — especially when working with exotic animals. Things change fast in veterinary care, and what was once considered a death sentence may now be manageable, treatable, or even curable.
If you work with species that aren’t routinely seen in general practice — like guinea pigs, rabbits, chinchillas, rats, or reptiles — it’s essential to stay educated, and to be an advocate for your animals when a vet hasn’t kept up. You may encounter well-meaning professionals who recommend palliative care or even euthanasia for conditions that now have multiple treatment options.

Let’s talk about a few examples:

### Ovarian Cysts in Guinea Pigs

It wasn’t long ago that ovarian cysts meant immediate euthanasia, or at best, suffering with no real treatment. But now?

 - Spay surgeries are more routine thanks to safer anesthesia and improved surgical techniques.
 - Flank spays are an option with some experienced exotics vets, often with less recovery time.
 - Hormone therapy (like leuprolide or deslorelin) can reduce cyst size and improve quality of life.
 - The current go-to treatment is Cystorelin (generic name: gonadorelin), which is widely accessible, relatively affordable, and has shown promising results. It’s often administered in a series of injections and can not only reduce symptoms like hair loss and aggression but, in some cases, eradicate the cysts entirely. Cystorelin is commonly chosen now due to its availability and cost-effectiveness.
 - Previously, Lupron (leuprolide acetate) was the preferred hormonal treatment. However, it has become much harder to source and significantly more expensive, putting it out of reach for many rescues and pet owners. While still effective, Lupron is typically reserved for cases where Cystorelin is not an option or hasn’t worked.
 - Regardless of which hormone treatment is used, it’s crucial that administration be done under veterinary supervision and with a clear diagnosis. These treatments can drastically improve a guinea pig’s quality of life and avoid more invasive procedures—but only when used correctly.
 - Even if surgery isn’t possible, there are options — and importantly, cyst rupture is not necessarily painful, according to recent studies. (Though we don’t suggest letting them rupture if there’s a safer intervention.)

### Heart Disease & Labored Breathing

Respiratory distress used to be a guessing game — usually presumed pneumonia.

*Now we know:*

 - Heart disease is a common cause of labored breathing in guinea pigs and rabbits.
 - With diagnostics (like x-rays or echocardiograms), proper medications can extend and improve life.
 - Diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and other meds allow for long-term management in many cases.
 - A pig with a wheeze isn’t always sick — they might have a weak heart. Without the right vet input, that’s easy to miss.

### Arthritis, Pain, and Mobility Issues

Pain used to mean one of two things: meds or nothing.

*Now:*

 - There’s a wider range of pain meds being used more routinely and safely in exotics.
 - Laser therapy and acupuncture have proven benefits and are used increasingly in small animal medicine.
 - Mobility supports like soft bedding, physical therapy, and assistive devices make life better for aging or injured animals.

## The Takeaway: Stay Curious, Stay Current

The bottom line? Just because a condition was once a death sentence doesn’t mean it still is.

As rescuers, we have a responsibility to:

 - Keep learning
 - Question outdated assumptions
 - Advocate for second opinions
 - Connect with vets who care enough to keep learning, too

Sometimes a second opinion — or a little research — is the difference between palliative care and a second chance.

## Legal and Ethical Boundaries for Rescues Giving Medical Advice

It’s important to clarify a crucial boundary: rescues are not veterinarians, and we cannot legally diagnose animals, prescribe medications, or provide specific dosages—even if you send us a photo or describe the symptoms in detail. While we deeply understand and care about the animals we work with, it is illegal and unethical for us to give medical advice for animals that are not under the direct care of our veterinarians.

What we can do is help guide you in your own vet care journey. We can suggest a list of questions to ask your veterinarian, help you determine if it’s time to seek a second opinion, or share general experiences (not medical advice) that may help inform your next steps. But the bottom line is: we cannot diagnose, treat, or medicate your pet.

This is not only about legality—it’s about safety. Every animal is different, and even common conditions can present in unusual ways. Only a licensed veterinarian who has physically examined your pet is qualified to make medical decisions for them.
