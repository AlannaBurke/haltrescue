# Lymphoma

Lymphoma, or Lymphosarcoma, is a type of cancer found in guinea pigs. Lymphoma is a cancer of the blood that targets the lypmh nodes, resulting in swollen lymph nodes. 

## Symptoms

Symptoms include:
 - lethargy
 - weight loss
 - difficulty breathing
 - a scruffy, unkempt coat
 - swollen lymph nodes

## Detection

Unfortunately, lymphoma often advances significantly before symptoms are noticeable. Your vet will look for visible signs before running tests such as blood test and imaging to detect the cancer.

## Treatment

Lymphoma treatments may include surgery to remove tumors, radiation, and chemotherapy. Supportive care is also used either on its own or in conjunction with other therapies. Sadly, lymphoma is often detected too late for treatment to be effective, and hospice care is often the best choice.
