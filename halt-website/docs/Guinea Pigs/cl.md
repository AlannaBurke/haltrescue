# Caseous/Cervical Lymphadenitis in Guinea Pigs

Guinea pigs are beloved pets known for their friendly and gentle nature, but like all animals, they can be susceptible to a variety of health issues. One condition that can affect them is **Caseous Lymphadenitis (CL)**, a bacterial infection that causes swelling and abscesses in the lymph nodes. This disease can be serious and requires prompt treatment to avoid complications.

In this post, we’ll explore what Caseous Lymphadenitis is, its causes, signs, symptoms, and the treatment options available to keep your guinea pig healthy.

## What is Caseous Lymphadenitis?

Caseous Lymphadenitis is an infection mostly often caused by the bacteria **Streptococcus zooepidemicus**. This bacteria targets the lymph nodes of guinea pigs, leading to the formation of abscesses filled with a thick, cheese-like pus. The term “caseous” refers to this characteristic thick, cheesy appearance of the pus inside the abscesses.

Although CL is more commonly known in livestock like sheep and goats, it can also occur in guinea pigs. If left untreated, the bacteria can spread beyond the lymph nodes, causing more severe health problems and, in some cases, proving fatal.

## Are Cervical and Caseous Lymphadenitis the same thing?

While both terms describe inflammation of lymph nodes in guinea pigs, "cervical lymphadenitis" specifically refers to inflammation of lymph nodes in the neck area, while "caseous lymphadenitis" describes a type of lymph node abscessation, often occurring in the neck region, caused by a specific bacteria (usually Streptococcus zooepidemicus). While they can often overlap in location, "caseous lymphadenitis" is a more specific diagnosis indicating a pus-filled abscess within the lymph node; essentially, cervical lymphadenitis can be a symptom of caseous lymphadenitis if the abscess is located in the neck lymph nodes.

## Causes of Caseous Lymphadenitis

CL in guinea pigs is typically caused by bacterial entry through a break in the skin, such as a wound or scratch. There are several ways your guinea pig could contract the bacteria:

	•	**Injury or Scratches:** Open wounds from rough play, fights with cage mates, or sharp objects in their environment can allow bacteria to enter.  
	•	**Dental Disease:** Guinea pigs are prone to dental issues, and infections around the teeth can easily spread to nearby lymph nodes.  
	•	**Bite Wounds:** Guinea pigs that live in groups may occasionally bite each other, leading to small puncture wounds that become infected.  
	•	**Contaminated Environment:** Poor hygiene or unsanitary living conditions can increase the risk of bacterial infections.  
	•	**Zoonotic Transfer:** Although rare, humans can transfer the bacteria to guinea pigs if they’ve been in contact with infected animals or environments. It’s also possible for CL to be transmitted from guinea pigs to humans, generally those with compromised immune systems. 

Once the bacteria enter the body, it travels to the nearest lymph node, where it can multiply and form abscesses.

## Signs and Symptoms of Caseous Lymphadenitis

The most obvious sign of CL in guinea pigs is the appearance of swollen lymph nodes, particularly around the neck or jaw area. However, there are other symptoms to watch for that may indicate the infection has spread or is causing further health issues:

1. **Swollen Lymph Nodes**: Enlarged or swollen lymph nodes, especially around the neck or under the jaw, are the most common symptom. These may appear as lumps that feel firm to the touch and can range in size from small to very large.  
2. **Abscesses**: Over time, the infected lymph nodes will develop abscesses filled with thick, caseous pus. These abscesses may rupture, leaking the pus externally, which can lead to secondary infections.  
3. **Loss of Appetite**: Guinea pigs with CL may lose interest in food due to discomfort or pain from the swollen lymph nodes, particularly if they are near the mouth or throat. This can lead to weight loss and dehydration, both of which are serious concerns.  
4. **Lethargy**: Like many infections, CL can cause general lethargy or a lack of energy. If your guinea pig seems less active than usual, spends more time hiding, or isn’t interacting as they normally do, it could be a sign of illness.  
5. **Difficulty Breathing**: If the abscesses become large enough, particularly around the neck, they can obstruct the airway and make it difficult for your guinea pig to breathe. This is a serious symptom and requires immediate veterinary attention.  
6. **Secondary Infections**: If the abscesses rupture, they can lead to further bacterial infections in surrounding tissues. This can exacerbate symptoms and make treatment more complicated.

## Diagnosing Caseous Lymphadenitis

If you notice any of the above symptoms in your guinea pig, it’s essential to seek veterinary care as soon as possible. Your veterinarian will likely perform a physical examination to identify swollen lymph nodes and may recommend additional diagnostic tests such as:  
	•	**Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA):** A sample of the pus may be taken from the abscess to confirm the presence of Corynebacterium bacteria.  
	•	**Bacterial Culture:** If the abscesses rupture, the pus can be cultured to identify the specific bacteria responsible.  
	•	**X-rays or Ultrasound:** In some cases, imaging may be used to determine the extent of the infection and check if it has spread to other areas, such as internal organs or deeper tissues.

## Treatment Options for Caseous Lymphadenitis

Treating Caseous Lymphadenitis in guinea pigs typically involves a combination of surgical and medical interventions. Since the disease is bacterial in nature, it requires prompt treatment to prevent the infection from spreading or worsening.

1. **Surgical Drainage or Removal**: The most effective way to treat CL is by surgically draining or removing the abscesses or even the entire lymph node. This helps to eliminate the bulk of the infected tissue and reduce the risk of further spread. Abscesses may need to be drained multiple times if they reoccur or if not all of the infection is removed during surgery.  
2. **Antibiotics**: After surgery, your veterinarian will likely prescribe antibiotics to help clear up any remaining infection and prevent new abscesses from forming. Common antibiotics for guinea pigs include enrofloxacin or doxycycline, but it’s important to use only vet-approved antibiotics, as certain medications are toxic to guinea pigs. While penicillin is generally not given to guinea pigs, in some cases it is the only antibiotic that is effective against CL.   
3. **Pain Relief**: If your guinea pig is in pain from swollen lymph nodes or surgery, pain relief medications such as meloxicam may be prescribed to help them stay comfortable during recovery.  
4. **Supportive Care**: Supportive care is essential, particularly if your guinea pig has lost weight or is dehydrated. This may involve syringe feeding with high-fiber food, providing plenty of fresh water, and ensuring a stress-free environment for recovery.  
5. **Abscess Management**: After surgery, you will need to monitor the surgical sites closely to ensure they heal properly. Clean the wound as directed by your vet and watch for any signs of re-infection, such as redness, swelling, or discharge.

## Preventing Caseous Lymphadenitis

While there is no guaranteed way to prevent CL, there are several steps you can take to reduce the risk of your guinea pig contracting the disease:

* **Keep infected pets away from healthy pets**. While it was once thought that infected pets had to be kept in another room in order to prevent the spread of infection, it is sufficient to keep them in another cage, as it is spread mainly by saliva.   
* **Maintain Good Hygiene:** Keep your guinea pig’s living area clean and free of sharp objects that could cause injury.  
* **Monitor Interactions with Other Pets:** If your guinea pigs live in groups, monitor their behavior to avoid fights or biting. Separating aggressive guinea pigs can help prevent wounds that lead to infection.  
* **Regular Health Checks:** Perform routine health checks on your guinea pig, especially around their jaw and neck, to catch any signs of swelling or abscesses early.  
* **Promptly Treat Wounds:** If your guinea pig does suffer from an injury, clean and disinfect it immediately to prevent bacterial entry.

## Final Thoughts

Caseous Lymphadenitis is a serious condition that requires immediate veterinary attention to ensure the best outcome for your guinea pig. If you notice any signs of swollen lymph nodes, abscesses, or changes in your guinea pig’s behavior, it’s important to act quickly. With prompt diagnosis and treatment, many guinea pigs recover well and can continue to lead healthy, happy lives.  
Keep a close eye on your guinea pig’s health, and don’t hesitate to consult a veterinarian at the first sign of trouble. Your vigilance can make all the difference in preventing and managing this painful disease.
