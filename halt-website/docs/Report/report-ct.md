# Report Pet Store Neglect in Connecticut

## **1\. Who actually investigates in Connecticut?**

In CT, most cruelty complaints (including **small animals in pet stores**) are handled by:

* **Local Animal Control Officers (ACOs)**  
  * Usually part of the **town’s police department** or a municipal agency.    
* **Connecticut Department of Agriculture – Animal Control Unit (DOAG ACU)**  
  * The **state-level unit responsible for investigating and making arrests** on animal-cruelty complaints. They also provide a **statewide reporting form**.    
* **Local police**  
  * For emergencies or when no local ACO is available, the police department can respond and coordinate with the ACU.  

You **do not** need to figure out who’s “right” before you report; if you report to one (e.g., local ACO or DOAG), they can route it.

## **2\. Key Connecticut laws that apply to pet-store small animals**

### **a) Cruelty / neglect – CT Gen. Stat. § 53-247**

Connecticut’s primary cruelty law is **§ 53-247**. It covers **all animals**, not just dogs and cats. It makes it illegal to:

* **Overwork, torture, cruelly beat, unjustifiably injure or kill** an animal  
* **Fail to provide proper food, drink or shelter**  
* **Fail to provide proper veterinary care**  
* **Abandon** an animal or carry/drive it in a cruel or inhumane manner  

Penalties range from fines for lesser neglect to misdemeanors and felonies for intentional or aggravated cruelty.

Because “animal” is defined broadly, this statute covers **guinea pigs, rabbits, hamsters, rats, birds, reptiles, etc.**

---

### **b) Pet shop licensing & humane treatment – CT Gen. Stat. § 22-344 & regs**

* **Conn. Gen. Stat. § 22-344** requires **pet shops to be licensed by the Commissioner of Agriculture** and authorizes DOAG to inspect them. It explicitly requires **“humane treatment of animals”** in pet shops and allows fines and license actions for violations.    
* The implementing regulations under **Title 22, Subtitle 22-344** (Pet Shop Regulations) set standards for:  
  * Housing, primary enclosures, sanitation  
  * Required care and handling  
  * Prohibited sales (e.g., very young poultry, venomous reptiles/amphibians/arachnids, certain turtles)  

These rules apply to **any “pet shop”**, which in practice includes businesses selling **small mammals, birds, reptiles, etc.**, not just dogs and cats.

---

### **c) Pet-shop “lemon law” (mostly dogs/cats)**

* § 22-344b (pet shop vet checks & refunds) focuses on **dogs and cats** (vet exams, buyer remedies, etc.).    
* It’s useful for understanding the regulatory ecosystem, but your **main tools for small animals** are:  
  * **Cruelty statute § 53-247**, and  
  * **Pet shop licensing/humane treatment rules under § 22-344 and its regs.**

## **3\. What counts as cruelty/neglect for small animals in CT pet stores?**

When you walk into a pet store, here’s what should ring alarm bells for **small animals**:

* **Food & water problems**  
  * No water available, filthy bottles/bowls, algae or debris  
  * Wrong diet (e.g., seed mix for guinea pigs, iceberg lettuce only, inappropriate pellets), animals visibly thin or lethargic  
* **Enclosure & sanitation issues**  
  * Cages with **heavy buildup of urine/feces**, strong ammonia smell  
  * No clean bedding or dry resting area  
  * No hiding places for prey species (guinea pigs, hamsters, rats, rabbits)  
  * Rusted or broken wire that could injure animals  
* **Environmental problems for species**  
  * Reptiles kept **without heat lamps/UVB**, wrong substrate, or no hides  
  * Birds in cages too small to spread wings or perch properly  
  * Small mammals in drafty or overheated spots, right under A/C vents or in direct sun  
* **Overcrowding & mixing**  
  * Many animals crammed into one small cage  
  * Incompatible species housed together (e.g., rabbits with guinea pigs, aggressive animals with timid ones)  
  * Animals unable to move, stretch, or behave normally  
* **Visible illness or injury with no vet care**  
  * Open wounds, limping, head tilts, crusty eyes or nose, labored breathing  
  * Reptiles with stuck shed, sunken eyes, severely underweight bodies  
  * Birds with missing feathers, swelling, discharge, or sitting fluffed up and motionless on the cage bottom  
* **Regulatory red flags**  
  * No obvious pet-shop license or inspection info posted  
  * Store looks chronically filthy, animals clearly not being checked or cleaned regularly  
  * Staff dismissing serious health concerns, refusing vet care, or refusing to separate obviously ill animals

Any of these can indicate violations of **§ 53-247 (cruelty/neglect)** and/or **§ 22-344 pet shop humane treatment regulations**.

## **4\. How to report suspected abuse/neglect (step by step)**

### **Step 1 – Document everything**

If it’s safe and you’re in public areas only:

* Write down:  
  * **Store name, full address, town, and county**  
  * **Date and time** you were there  
* Note:  
  * **Species & number** of animals (e.g., 8 guinea pigs in one cage, 4 rabbits, 2 bearded dragons)  
  * Detailed description of conditions (cage size, bedding, food/water, smells, visible illness)  
* Take **photos/videos** if you can do so without trespassing or causing a scene  
* Record **staff statements** (“they’re just stressed,” “we don’t have a vet”)  
* Note any **other witnesses** who might be willing to confirm what they saw

---

### **Step 2 – Decide if it’s an emergency**

If you think animals are in **immediate danger of serious injury or death** (e.g., collapsed animals, extreme heat/cold, active physical abuse):

* **Call 911** or your **local police** and say you are reporting **animal cruelty in progress at a pet store**.  
* Give the address, what species, and exactly what you’re seeing.

---

### **Step 3 – Report to local Animal Control / police**

For non-immediate but serious situations:

1. **Contact the town/city Animal Control Officer** (often via the police or town hall).  
   * Many towns list ACO contact info on their website; CT Humane Society and National Link Coalition both confirm ACOs handle most cruelty investigations.    
2. Tell them you want to report **suspected animal cruelty/neglect at a pet store involving small animals**.  
3. Provide:  
   * Store name & address  
   * What species you saw and in what condition  
   * Any photos/videos or witnesses  
   * Your contact info (you can ask about anonymity, but giving contact helps them follow up)

Ask if a **cruelty investigation under § 53-247** will be opened.

---

### **Step 4 – Submit a report to the CT Department of Agriculture (Animal Control Unit)**

The DOAG Animal Control Unit **also investigates cruelty and can make arrests**.  

* Use the **“Suspected Animal Abuse Report – General Public” form** (PDF) and send it to the address or email listed (AGR.AnimalControl@ct.gov).    
* Include:  
  * Your contact info  
  * Owner/business info (pet store name & address)  
  * Detailed description of conditions  
  * Indicate this is a **pet shop / commercial setting** and small animals are involved  
* Attach or note that you have photos/videos available.

---

### **Step 5 – Also notify the DOAG / local health authority about pet shop violations**

Because pet shops must be **licensed and inspected** under § 22-344 and the related regulations, you can also:

* Contact DOAG (pet shop licensing / animal facilities) and explain you believe this licensed pet shop is **not providing humane treatment** as required by § 22-344.    
* Contact the **local health department** (town or regional) if conditions are unsanitary (odor, waste, pests, etc.).

This creates **both a cruelty case and a facility-compliance case**, which can be very effective.

---

### **Step 6 – Follow up and escalate if needed**

* Ask for **case or complaint numbers** when you file reports.  
* Keep a log of:  
  * Dates you reported  
  * Who you spoke with  
  * What they told you  
* If there’s no action and conditions remain bad:  
  * Follow up with DOAG ACU  
  * Contact your **State’s Attorney’s office** for the judicial district where the store is located  
  * Consider contacting an advocacy group (e.g., Desmond’s Army, CT Votes for Animals) to amplify concerns

## **5\. Sample report text (for small animals at a CT pet store)**

You can adapt this for email, the DOAG form, or a phone script:

I am reporting suspected animal cruelty and neglect at a pet store in Connecticut involving small animals (guinea pigs / rabbits / hamsters / birds / reptiles).

**Store name:** \[Store Name\]  
**Address:** \[Street, Town, CT ZIP\]  
**Date(s) & time(s) observed:** \[List\]

I observed the following conditions:  
– \[Example\] Eight guinea pigs housed in one small wire cage with no hiding places. The bedding was soaked with urine and feces, there was a strong ammonia odor, and at least two guinea pigs appeared very thin and lethargic.  
– \[Example\] Several hamsters and rats housed with no clean water; the bottles were either empty or filled with greenish water.  
– \[Example\] Two reptiles kept in glass tanks with no visible heat source or hides, and the tanks appeared very dirty.

Based on what I observed, I am concerned that these conditions violate **Connecticut General Statutes § 53-247 (cruelty to animals)** and the **pet shop humane treatment requirements under § 22-344 and its regulations**.

I have **photos/videos** and am willing to share them and cooperate with any investigation.

**Your name & contact info** (or state that you prefer not to be contacted, if allowed).  

## **6\. Why your report matters**

* Small animals, birds and reptiles are often **overlooked in pet-store enforcement**, even though they have very specific care needs.  
* CT has **strong cruelty laws and pet shop regulations** on the books — but they only work when people report what they see.    
* Your documentation can:  
  * Trigger inspections and cruelty investigations  
  * Help DOAG and local ACOs take action  
  * Protect current animals and prevent future suffering
