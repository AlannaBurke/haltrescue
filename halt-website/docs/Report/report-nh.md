# Report Pet Store Neglect in New Hampshire

### **1\. Who to contact & oversight**

* If you **see immediate abuse or danger**, call your local **police department** and report suspected animal cruelty.    
* You can also report to the state via the New Hampshire Department of Agriculture, Markets & Food (NH DOAMF) Animal Control Unit.    
* The New Hampshire Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NHSPCA) accepts online reports of cruelty/neglect.  

By reporting to one of these, you initiate an investigation — you don’t have to figure out which body has immediate jurisdiction.

### **2\. Relevant laws for small animals**

* **RSA 644:8 – Cruelty to Animals**: Defines “cruelty” to include acts or omissions injurious or detrimental to the health, safety or welfare of any animal, including abandoning an animal without proper provision for care, sustenance, protection or shelter.    
* “Animal” in this statute is defined broadly (domestic animal, household pet, or a wild animal in captivity) which encompasses small mammals, birds, reptiles.    
* The law allows for misdemeanor or felony charges depending on severity.  

While New Hampshire may not have a highly detailed pet-shop small-animal regulation specific to all species (in the accessible summary), the cruelty statute is a strong legal foundation for small-animal neglect/abuse.

### **3\. What qualifies as cruelty or neglect for small animals in a pet store**

When you walk into a pet store and there are small mammals/birds/reptiles, watch for signs like:

* **Food & water issues**  
  * Filthy or empty water bottles/bowls; species-inappropriate diet; signs of dehydration or extreme weight loss.  
* **Poor housing / sanitation**  
  * Wire cages with no resting surface, heavy feces/urine accumulation, cages leaving animals unable to move freely, no hiding spaces for prey species (hamsters, guinea pigs, rabbits).  
* **Environmental/habitat issues**  
  * Reptiles or birds without proper heat/UVB/light/hides; prey-species exposed to drafts or loud areas; enclosures too small for natural behavior.  
* **Overcrowding / mixing incompatible species**  
  * Too many animals in one enclosure, mixing prey and predator species, or animals that cannot turn around or act naturally.  
* **Visible illness / untreated injury**  
  * Animals with crusty eyes, missing fur/feathers, limping, abnormal behaviour, refusing to move, skin lesions, reptile shedding issues, birds perched oddly or fluffed up on cage floor.  
* **Regulation red flags**  
  * No posted inspection/license certificate (if required), visibly poor facility housekeeping, repeated deaths of animals, staff dismissing concerns.

Any of these could form the basis of a violation under the cruelty law (RSA 644:8) and trigger an investigation.

### **4\. Step-by-step: How to report the suspected abuse**

**Step 1 – Document your observation**

* Store name, full address (town, county).  
* Date(s) and time(s) of your visit/observation.  
* Species involved (guinea pigs, rabbits, hamsters, reptiles, birds, etc.).  
* Specific description of what you saw: number of animals, cage/enclosure condition, food/water status, behavior/health of animals.  
* Take **photos/videos** from public areas if safe/legal.  
* Write any staff or witness comments or refusal to show license.  
* Note any witness names/contact info (with permission) if applicable.

**Step 2 – If you believe animals are in immediate danger**

* If you see animals seriously injured, unable to move, collapsing, extreme heat/cold exposure, or active abuse: **Call 911** or your local police and report “animal cruelty in progress at a pet store.”  
* Provide location, species and what you are seeing.

**Step 3 – File a cruelty report**

* Contact your local police department or ACO and say you want to report suspected cruelty/neglect at a pet store involving small animals.  
* Provide your documentation, what you observed, store info, species involved, photos/videos if you have.  
* Mention your concern that conditions may violate RSA 644:8.  
* If you wish, you can also contact NH DOAMF’s animal control unit and send a report.  

**Step 4 – Follow up & escalate if needed**

* Ask for a case number/reference.  
* Keep track: the date you reported, whom you spoke with, and what action they said they will take.  
* If you’re not seeing action, you can contact the **county sheriff’s office** or talk with a regional humane organization (e.g., NHSPCA) and ask if they can assist.  
* In your network, you may want to alert rescue groups so they can monitor for repeated problems with the store.

### **5\. Sample report script (for small-animal pet-store abuse)**

I am reporting suspected animal cruelty and neglect at a pet store in New Hampshire involving small animals (guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits, birds, reptiles).

**Store name:** \[Store Name\]  
**Address:** \[Street, Town, County, NH ZIP\]  
**Date(s) & time(s) observed:** \[List\]

**What I observed:**  
– \[Example\] Seven guinea pigs housed in a single wire cage with no hide boxes; bedding saturated with urine; two guinea pigs appeared very thin and lethargic.  
– \[Example\] Several reptiles displayed in glass tanks with minimal substrate and no visible heat lamp; one was pressed against the glass and barely moving.  
– Water bottles for hamsters and rats were either empty or leaking; food bowls not refilled for hours.

I believe these conditions may violate **RSA 644:8 (Cruelty to Animals)** because the animals seem to be deprived of necessary care and proper housing.  
I have **photos/videos**, and I am willing to share them if needed.

Contact info: \[Your phone/email or state you wish to remain anonymous\].

### **6\. Why your action matters**

* Small mammals, birds and reptiles in pet-store settings are especially vulnerable because their needs are very specific and they may be overlooked under more generic dog/cat-focused regulation.  
* Reporting keeps pressure on stores to meet minimum standards of care and may lead to inspections, enforcement or closure before more animals suffer.  
* Documentation of poor conditions often leads to investigations and can help establish patterns of abuse/neglect, making enforcement easier in future.  
* By you stepping up, you are helping protect the voiceless animals and supporting higher welfare standards in the industry.
