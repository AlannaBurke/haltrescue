# Report Pet Store Neglect in Massachusetts

## **1\. Who investigates animal cruelty in Massachusetts?**

In Massachusetts, **animal cruelty—including in pet stores—can be investigated by multiple agencies**, and any one of them can take the report:

### **Primary enforcement agencies**

* **Local Police Department**  
  * MA law (M.G.L. c. 272 §77) designates animal cruelty as a **criminal offense**, enforced by police.  
* **Municipal Animal Control**  
  * Many ACOs work under police departments and respond to cruelty complaints.  
* **Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (MSPCA)**  
  * Has officers with law-enforcement authority to investigate cruelty statewide.  
  * Cruelty complaint form & hotline available.  
* **Animal Rescue League of Boston (ARL)**  
  * Also has law-enforcement authority for cruelty investigations.

**You do NOT need to know which agency is correct — report to one and they will route it.**  

## **2\. Key Massachusetts Laws that Apply to Small Animals in Pet Stores**

### **Criminal Cruelty Law – M.G.L. c. 272 §77**

Illegal to:

* Torture, torment, injure, cruelly beat, or **fail to provide proper food, drink, shelter, sanitary conditions, or veterinary care**.  
* Abandon or expose an animal to suffering or danger.  
* Applies to **“every animal”** – including guinea pigs, rabbits, hamsters, rats, reptiles, and birds.

### **Examples you may observe:**

#### **Food & Water Problems**

* No water, empty/dirty bottles, algae.  
* Wrong food (e.g., seed mix for guinea pigs, iceberg lettuce only).  
* Animals thin, weak, dehydrated.

#### **Sanitation & Enclosure Issues**

* Strong ammonia smell, heavy waste buildup.  
* No clean bedding, no hiding huts for prey species.  
* Rusted cages or unsafe flooring that causes wounds.

## **4\. How to Report Suspected Cruelty (Step-by-Step)**

### **Step 1 – Document the Situation**

If safe:

* Store name, full address, town.  
* Species & number of animals observed.  
* What you saw, smelled, heard.  
* Photos/videos from public areas.  
* Staff statements & witness info if available.  
* Date and time of visit.

### **Step 2 – Decide if it’s an Emergency**

**If animals are in immediate danger** (collapsed, severe injuries, extreme heat/cold, active abuse):

📞 **Call 911** and report **animal cruelty in progress** at a pet store.

---

### **Step 3 – File a Cruelty Report**

You can report to ANY of the following (and multiple is okay):

| Agency | How to Report |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Local Police** | Call the non-emergency number & say you are reporting suspected animal cruelty |
| **Local Animal Control** | Ask for investigation under M.G.L. c. 272 §77 |
| **MSPCA Law Enforcement** | cruelty@mspca.org or online form / hotline |
| **Animal Rescue League of Boston** | cruelty@arlboston.org or hotline |
| **MDAR (Pet Shop Licensing Unit)** | Report violations of 330 CMR 12.00 & request inspection |

Ask for **a case or incident number** and follow up.

---

### **Step 4 – Follow Up & Escalation**

If no response or the situation is severe:

* Contact the **District Attorney** for that county  
* Contact MDAR directly for licensing enforcement  
* Connect with regional rescues / advocates to encourage multiple reports
