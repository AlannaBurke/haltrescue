# Report Pet Store Neglect in Pennsylvania

## **1\. Oversight & jurisdiction for small animals in Pennsylvania**

When a pet store is selling or housing small animals, the agencies below may apply:

* Local police or the county district attorney’s office — animal cruelty laws (see below) cover *all animals* in the Commonwealth, including small animals.    
* Humane Society Police Officers (HSPOs) — many humane societies in PA are empowered to investigate cruelty/neglect cases involving any species of animal.    
* If the facility also sells dogs (or is a kennel) then the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture (PDA) via the Bureau of Dog Law may have additional regulatory power — but that typically concerns dogs.  
* If the pet store acts as a **wholesale dealer**, or supplies animals federally regulated (for instance some small mammals, birds or reptiles when used for research/trade) then the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) may be involved under the Animal Welfare Act.    
* Note: Even though many specific “small animal” species aren’t the primary focus of certain dog-laws or puppy-laws, the general cruelty/neglect statutes apply to *all animals*.

## **2\. Applicable laws for small animals in Pennsylvania**

### **General cruelty/neglect laws (covering small animals)**

* **18 Pa.C.S. § 5532 – Neglect of animal**  
  The statute states: a person who has charge, care or custody of an animal fails to provide necessary sustenance, potable water, access to clean/sanitary shelter & protection from weather, or necessary veterinary care.    
  This applies to “each animal to which the person has a duty of care, whether belonging to himself or otherwise.”    
* **18 Pa.C.S. § 5533 – Cruelty to animal**  
  A person intentionally, knowingly or recklessly ill-treats, overloads, beats, abandons, or abuses an animal. “Animal” is defined broadly and studies show small animals are included.    
* **18 Pa.C.S. § 5534 – Aggravated cruelty to animal**  
  Includes when someone violates neglect/cruelty provisions and the act causes serious bodily injury or death of the animal. Felony grade.  

### **Small-animal-specific statute mention**

* The Animal Destruction Method Authorization Law (Act No. 83 of 1983, as amended) defines “small domestic animals” (rabbits, mice, rats, hamsters, guinea pigs, ferrets, birds, reptiles, amphibians) and covers euthanasia methods and protections.    
  Although this law focuses on proper methods of euthanasia rather than sales/conditions, the definition is helpful in understanding that the law recognises small animals.  
* There are also local municipal codes regulating small animals (for example transport/caging on property) though these are not state‐wide cruelty statutes.  

### **Why this matters for pet stores with small animals**

* Even if a store is selling rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits, reptiles, birds, etc., the **neglect and cruelty statutes apply** because they refer to “animal” broadly.  
* If you observed small animals in poor condition (dirty cages, no shelter/hiding place, no potable water, obvious illness), these laws provide a foundation.  
* While some regulatory frameworks focus on dogs/cats (for example the “puppy lemon law”) small animals may not have equivalent consumer protections — making cruelty/neglect laws especially important for them.

## **3\. What qualifies as cruelty or neglect for small animals in a pet store**

Here are examples adapted specifically for small animals:

* **Lack of potable water / food**: e.g., water bowls that are filthy, empty, or contaminated; food not appropriate to species; animals that appear emaciated or dehydrated.  
* **Unsanitary housing**: cages or enclosures with heavy accumulation of feces or urine; strong ammonia smell; lack of clean bedding; no hiding/rest area for prey animals (e.g., guinea pigs, rabbits) or appropriate substrate for reptiles/birds.  
* **Inadequate environmental conditions**:  
  * Temperature/humidity out of species’ required range (e.g., reptiles too cold/hot).  
  * No shelter/hiding area for prey species (rats, mice, guinea pigs).  
  * Inappropriate lighting or substrate for reptiles/birds.  
* **Obvious untreated illness or injury**: animals with visible wounds or missing fur, birds with matted feathers, reptiles with shedding problems, animals that cannot move or are obviously distressed.  
* **Over-crowding or mixing incompatible species**: many small animals crammed into a cage; prey species housed openly with predators; bird cages that are too small or have inadequate perches.  
* **Rough or improper handling**: staff mishandling small animals (e.g., dropping, grasping inappropriately), causing fear/distress or injury.  
* **Sale of animals not appropriate for the setting**: e.g., animals that are obviously sick or infants too young for sale, or species that require specialized care without the store providing adequate housing or information.  
* **Transport or holding conditions**: animals kept off-site in improper transport crates, or large numbers being held in back rooms without proper care.

Because these are small animals, some issues may be less visible (e.g., birds are stressed, reptiles undeveloped) — thorough documentation helps.

## **4\. Step-by-step for reporting small-animal cruelty/neglect at a pet store in Pennsylvania**

### **Step 1 – Document what you observe**

* Record the **store name and full address**.  
* Date(s) and time(s) of observation.  
* Detailed description of what you saw/photographed: species involved (rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits, birds, reptiles), number of animals, housing/enclosure condition, food/water status, visible signs of illness/distress, environmental issues (temperature, bedding, substrate, lighting), odor, pests, etc.  
* Take **photos/videos** if possible (from public area).  
* Note any staff interactions or statements (e.g., staff acknowledging animals are “just getting used to new home”, or discounting visible illness).  
* Note any witness(es), including other customers or employees, who may corroborate.  
* Keep everything safe—don’t endanger yourself, don’t enter restricted areas without permission.

### **Step 2 – Immediate danger?**

If you believe one or more small animals are in **imminent risk of serious harm or death** (for example: animals dying, severe dehydration, heat/cold exposure, active abuse):

* **Call 911** or your local police department and report animal cruelty in progress or life-threatening conditions.  
* Provide address, description of animals, what you believe is happening.

### **Step 3 – Report to a humane society / HSPO**

* Find the local humane society in the county the store is located.  
* Use their **animal cruelty/neglect reporting form or hotline**. For example, some PA humane societies have online forms.    
* In your report mention:  
  * That you are reporting **small animals in a pet store** (specify species) at the given address.  
  * Include your observations with details.  
  * Attach photos/videos if you have them.  
  * Provide your contact info (or state you prefer to be anonymous, though contact info often helps the investigation).

### **Step 4 – Follow-up and ask about enforcement**

* Ask whether the humane society has **Humane Society Police Officers (HSPOs)** with legal authority in that county. Some do — they can investigate and refer for prosecution.  
* If you have not heard back in a reasonable time, you may follow up and ask for the case number or status.  
* Keep copies of all your documentation (photos, date/time, your report submission).

### **Step 5 – Consider escalation if not addressed**

* If you believe your report is being ignored and conditions continue, you can also contact your **county district attorney’s office** to ask if they will investigate under the cruelty/neglect statutes (18 Pa.C.S. §§ 5532-5534).  
* You can contact your state legislators or state Attorney General’s office to raise concerns (especially if the store has a pattern of issues).  
* You can alert local media or social-media-based watchdogs for awareness (optional, but helpful when many animals are involved).

## **5\. Sample script/report (for small animals in Pennsylvania)**

I am reporting suspected animal cruelty and neglect at a pet store in Pennsylvania involving small animals (not dogs or cats).

Store name: \[Store Name\]  
Address: \[Street, City, ZIP\]  
Date(s) & Time(s) observed: \[List\]

I observed the following conditions:  
– Several guinea pigs and hamsters were housed together in one large wire cage with no separate hiding areas, bedding was soaked with urine, there was a strong ammonia odor, animals appeared lethargic and some had fur mats.  
– A pair of rabbits were kept in a cage without clean dry resting area or adequate enrichment; one rabbit had visible eye discharge and appeared to have trouble eating.  
– A selection of reptiles were displayed under inadequate heat lighting: one turtle’s water bowl was empty and another snake’s glass terrarium fogged with poor ventilation; no signage about proper care or hiding spots.  
– When I asked a staff member about the guinea pigs’ condition, they said the animals were “just new arrivals” and discounted concerns.

I have **photos/videos** showing the conditions and am willing to share them and cooperate with any investigation. I believe the conditions may violate Pennsylvania’s animal cruelty statutes (18 Pa.C.S. §§ 5532-5534) and I request that your agency investigate as soon as possible.
