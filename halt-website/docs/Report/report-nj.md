## 1\. What may constitute a violation

Under New Jersey’s animal cruelty laws (N.J.S.A. 4:22-17), it is illegal to fail to provide animals with necessary care, including:

* Adequate housing, food, and clean water

* Sanitary conditions

* Protection from disease and injury

* Prompt veterinary care

New Jersey also licenses and inspects pet stores through local health departments. Stores can be fined or shut down if they fail to follow required standards.

Examples of reportable concerns:

* Sick animals (labored breathing, discharge, lethargy, untreated injury)

* Dirty, overcrowded, or inappropriate enclosures

* No access to clean water or food

* Strong ammonia or feces odor

* Animals displayed for sale while visibly ill

---

## 2\. Gather evidence

While in the store, record the following (as factually as possible):

### Store details

* Store name and address

* Date and time of visit

* Staff names on nametags or receipts

* Types and number of animals present

### Condition documentation

Examples of useful notes:

* “Three chinchillas in 2×2 ft glass enclosure. One lying on side, breathing rapidly, eyes crusted.”

* “No water bottle visible. Heavy odor of ammonia.”

### Photos and videos

If allowed in public areas, discreetly take:

* Photos of animals and cages

* Photos of enclosure conditions (food/water availability, waste buildup)

* Tags or signage displaying breeder information

### Witnesses

If others observe the same issue, ask if they are willing to provide a statement.

## 3\. File an animal cruelty report

Animal cruelty cases in NJ are handled by Humane Law Enforcement Officers (HLEOs) through the local police department and county prosecutor.

### To report suspected cruelty:

1. Call the local police non-emergency number

2. Request to speak with the Humane Law Enforcement Officer

3. Provide documented facts
   
4. State: you believe conditions may violate the cruelty statute (N.J. Stat. § 4:22-17 et seq.) and pet shop facility regulations (N.J.A.C. 8:23A).


Suggested script:

“I’d like to report suspected animal cruelty at a pet store. There are animals showing signs of illness and lack of necessary care. I have photos, dates, and detailed notes. How can I submit this information to the Humane Law Enforcement Officer?”

Ask for:

## 6\. File a Consumer Complaint – Division of Consumer Affairs

* Birth date, sex, markings, and identifying microchip/tattoo information

* Date and veterinarian of health exam

* On-cage display of the two most recent inspections of the breeding facility

Note: The Pet Purchase Protection Act formally applies to dogs and cats, but complaints about sick animals of any species at retail stores may still be investigated under consumer fraud, cruelty, and licensing law.
