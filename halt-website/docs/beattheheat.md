# Help Your Small Pets Beat the Heat

It's getting warmer - here are some tips to help your small pets stay cool and comfortable in the heat. 

 - Keep their space shaded and ventilated
 - Close curtains or blinds during peak sun.
 - Use fans to circulate air (never blow directly on the animal).
 - Avoid placing enclosures near windows.
 - Use chilled ceramic tiles, bricks, or marble slabs as cool surfaces to lie on.
 - Wrap frozen water bottles in a sock or cloth and place near their hideout.
 - Use chilled ceramic tiles, bricks, or marble slabs as cool surfaces to lie on.
 - Ensure fresh, cool water is always available
 - Change water often to keep it cool.
 - Add a few ice cubes to water bottles or bowls (if they don’t discourage drinking).
 - Don’t transport animals during the hottest part of the day.
 - Use cooling pads (with supervision)
 - Pet-safe gel pads or freezer packs can help — just make sure they can’t chew them.
 - Keeping the lights off may make it feel cooler and encourage your pets to rest.
