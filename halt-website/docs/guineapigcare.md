# Guinea Pig Care

## Food and Diet

### What type of food should I feed my guinea pig?

Plain, quality pellets are best for guinea pigs. Guinea pigs under 6 months old should be fed an Alfalfa pellet and hay-based diet. Do not feed your guinea pig any food with artificial coloring, seeds or corn as these foods pose a choking hazard and cannot be properly digested.

Kleenmama hay and pellets are the best hay and pellets hat you can
provide for your guinea pig. Their shipping prices can be intimidating, but it is more less expensive to order online than to buy in pet stores, even with shipping. Kleenmama hay and pellets can be ordered online at www.kmshayloft.com.

Oxbow Essentials is the second best in quality. Though it can be more expensive than buying in bulk, it can be much more convenient to find and purchase in stores. For store locations, visit https://www.oxbowanimalhealth.com/store-locator.

Sweet Meadow also provides quality hay and pellets. They can be
ordered in bulk and shipping is a bit more reasonable. It is important to note that their winter hay isn’t as good as their late spring and summer hay. To order, visit www.sweetmeadowfarm.com.

Small Pet Select provides quality hay and pellets as well.
To order, visit www.smallpetselect.com.

### What about fresh foods?

Guinea pigs should be given fresh vegetables on a daily basis. Fresh fruits are also safe, but should only be given as a treat, not as a primary source of nutrition. Many grocery stores are willing to set aside some of their daily veggie scraps if you call and request them in advance. Guinea pigs who eat a regular diet of veggies and fruits do not need vitamin C supplemented unless your cavy savvy veterinarian recommends it for a
specific health issue. For a full list of fresh foods and their nutritional
values for guinea pigs, visit www.guinealynx.info/chart.html.

### Can I give my guinea pig treats?

An occasional treat is fine, but remember that anything
with artificial colors, seeds or corn are not healthy or safe
for your guinea pig. Oxbow Essentials Small Animal
Treats are some of the best treats you can purchase for
your guinea pig. You can also give your guinea pig a
piece of fresh fruit as a treat.

## Housing and Toys

### How much space does my guinea pig need?

Your average chain store will sell you a cage that is much too small (and overpriced). A single piggy needs at least 2x3 feet of space, while a pair of piggies will need at least 2x4 feet and a trio will need a minimum of 2x5 feet. Bigger is always better.

### What type of cage do I need for my guinea pig?

Consider purchasing or building a C&C cage. C&C cages can be
purchased online for easier assembly at www.guineapigcagesstore.com. Their price for a jumbo size cage is still cheaper than a “large” cage from the pet store and they support animal rescues. You can also purchase individual supplies to build a C&C cage. Bed Bath & Beyond carries Grid Wire Modular Shelving and Storage Cubes that can be used for the frame. Local sign stores often carry sheets of Coroplast and if you tell them that it’s for building a guinea pig cage, they will sometimes sell it at
a discounted rate, especially if you are not fussy about the color.

### What kind of bedding should I buy?

Never use cedar bedding. Cedar gives off an oily residue that can get stuck in your guinea pig’s lungs and cause severe upper respiratory issues. Consider using a fleece cage liner instead. Fleece cage liners help to reduce dust and allergies and are very soft. They can be shaken out, tossed into the wash and used over and over again.

### Where can I purchase fleece cage liners?

Fleece cage liners can be purchased online from
guineapigmarket.com, www.etsy.com/shop/TheGuineaPigSlave, or
letsleepingpigslie.com and a portion of their sales will be donated to local rescues. https://guineadad.com/ also makes excellent liners and supports rescues.

### What about toys?

Guinea pigs are not much for playing with toys, but do enjoy paper towel rolls stuffed with hay, clean paper bags with hay inside, empty oatmeal containers, old socks filled with bedding, apple tree branches and children’s wooden blocks. For baby piggies, be sure to cut paper towel rolls lengthwise to keep them from getting stuck. Also make sure that apple tree branches come from a pesticide-free yard.
