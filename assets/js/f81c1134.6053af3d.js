Thankfully, nothing was outright terrible\u2014but we did learn some surprising things about a few of our little ones. Here\u2019s a full update!\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### \ud83d\udc2d Sherlock the Chinchilla\\n\\nNo surprise here\u2014Sherlock needs a dental surgery, which is scheduled for Wednesday. We absolutely need help covering the cost of this procedure. Donations, shares, and good vibes are all deeply appreciated.\\n\\n\u2e3b\\n\\n### \ud83d\udc39 Caper\\n\\nCaper came in for a recheck. I just wanted to be absolutely sure that his drooling was from having no incisors (rather than bad molars). His molars look fantastic!\\n\\nCaper is actually the first small animal I\u2019ve had with zero incisors\u2014I\u2019ve seen many missing one or two, but not all four. He\u2019s growing slowly and is much smaller than his brother, and may just be a tiny guy for life.\\n\\nSadly, based on past experience, very stunted pigs often have shorter life spans due to poor genetics. I knew this going in, but it doesn\u2019t make it any easier. These babies have my whole heart, and when their time comes, I will not be okay.\\n\\n\u2e3b\\n\\n### \ud83d\udc39 Kavita\\n\\nKavita got her second hormone injection today, and it\u2019s already helping! Her hair is growing back and the ovarian cysts have shrunk significantly after just one dose. We\u2019re hopeful this second round will resolve things completely.\\n\\n\u2e3b\\n\\n### \ud83d\udc39 Haiku\\n\\nHaiku was meant to be seen just for a heart check, but she was very painful and grumpy with the tech and Dr. Ford\u2014very unlike her.\\n\\nShe\u2019s been eating well and has great poops, but has lost weight. We were discussing possible arthritis and other ideas when she urinated on the table\u2014and all three of us noticed how diluted her urine looked.\\n\\nWe took a sample and sent it for testing. Kidney issues would explain the weight loss\u2026 and while her heart sounded good today, possible kidney disease is deeply concerning.\\n\\n\u2e3b\\n\\n### \ud83d\udc39 Rhyme (Mother of the Lethals)\\n\\nI brought Rhyme in to confirm that she wasn\u2019t pregnant again (she\u2019s not). During the ultrasound, however, we discovered that her colon has adhered to her bladder\u2014a not-uncommon result of pregnancy and birth.\\n\\nThere\u2019s nothing to be done now, but it\u2019s critical information in case she ever needs abdominal surgery.\\n\\nWe also saw that her bladder looked inflamed, even though she has no UTI symptoms. She\u2019s starting a round of antibiotics and we\u2019ll recheck her soon.\\n\\n\u2e3b\\n\\n### \ud83d\udc39 Memoir\\n\\nMemoir is a stunning satin girl who arrived just under a month ago.

Kerrigan was born in the rescue on May 27, 2020, and was adopted as a baby before returning to us last June. I had a feeling she belonged with us, so she joined our large female herd, where she was surrounded by friends and love.\\n\\nNot long after her return, she was diagnosed with CHF. With Lasix and Pimobendan, we were able to manage her condition for quite a while. Kerrigan was a happy, affectionate girl who adored her herd and the extra cuddles she got during medication time. She\u2019s now reunited with her sister\u2014hopefully popcorning together over the rainbow bridge. \ud83d\udc95\\n\\n### Novel and Parody\\n\\n\ud83c\udf31 Now for some cautiously good news:\\nThe round-the-clock care over the past few weeks has been exhausting\u2014but it\u2019s starting to feel worth it. Our lethal babies are thriving, and both Novel and Parody seem to have turned a corner.\\n\\n\u2728 Novel is now holding himself upright instead of lying flat and floppy. Truthfully, I\u2019ve never had success bringing back an animal once they\u2019ve reached that point\u2014but Novel is alert, interested in food, has started urinating, and even let out a little protest during his last sub-q fluids. These are all wonderful signs.\\n\\n\u2728 Parody is full of curiosity and taking food like a champ. His poops are well-formed\u2014still not quite as much as we\u2019d like, but any output right now is a win.\\n\\nAfter days of being glued to their sides, terrified to step away, I finally feel like I can breathe a bit. I may even take a shower and grab some fresh veggies for the crew. (I also need to get my second rabies shot after that bat incident, but that\u2019s another story\u2026)\\n\\n![Kerrigan the Guinea Pig](kerrigan.jpg)\\n\\n![Guinea Pig](nh.jpg)\\n\\n![Guinea Pig](nh2.jpg)\\n\\n----\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude4f  Support Our Rescue Work\\n\\nIf you believe in the work we do, please consider making a contribution.\\nYour support helps us continue saving and caring for the most vulnerable small animals. \ud83d\udc95\\n\\n\u2e3b\\n\\n### \ud83d\udcb8  Ways to Donate\\n - PayPal: donations@helpingalllittlethings.org\\n - Venmo: [@haltrescue](https://account.venmo.com/u/haltrescue) (watch for imposters \u2014 it\u2019s _not_ haltrescue_)\\n - CashApp: [$haltrescue](https://cash.app/$Haltrescue)\\n - Mail a Check:  \\n  \\n    Helping All Little Things    \\n    PO Box 11    \\n    Deerfield, NH 03037    \\n    (Make checks payable to Helping All Little Things)    \\n\\n\\n### \ud83d\uded2 Wishlist Donations\\n - \ud83d\udecd\ufe0f [Amazon Wishlist](https://tinyurl.com/HALT-Amazon-Wishlist)\\n - \ud83d\udecd\ufe0f [Chewy Wishlist](https://tinyurl.com/HALT-Chewy-Wishlist)\\n\\n\\n### \ud83d\udcde Donate Directly to Our Vets\\n - Southern Maine Hospital for Small Mammals: (207) 535-9330\\n - House Paws: (856) 234-5230\\n(Note: The account may still be under Helping All Little Pipsqueaks \u2014 we\u2019re in the process of updating it.)\\n\\nThank you for your continued love and support.\\nEvery life matters, and we\u2019re so grateful you\u2019re part of this mission with us. \ud83d\udc39\ud83d\udc95"},{"id":"po","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/po","source":"@site/blog/2025-06-01-po/2025-06-01-po.md","title":"Adoption Alert - Po","description":"Adoption Alert: Po","date":"2025-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"adoptions","permalink":"/blog/tags/adoptions","description":"adoptions"}],"readingTime":0.39,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jen Dupee","title":"Board Member, Foster Parent, Volunteer","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/jen"},"imageURL":"/img/jen.jpg","key":"jen"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"po","title":"Adoption Alert - Po","authors":["jen"],"tags":["adoptions"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Updates from the NH Branch","permalink":"/blog/6-1-25-nh-update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Meet the Board of Directors","permalink":"/blog/board"}},"content":"## Adoption Alert: Po\\n\\nWe\u2019re thrilled to share that Po found his forever home this weekend\u2014with one of our longtime friends and supporters!

Boba has faced more than his fair share of challenges in his life, but he never gave up\u2014and now, he needs our help to overcome his toughest battle yet. Boba has been diagnosed with lymphoma, and he\u2019s scheduled to undergo surgery to remove a cancerous tumor. We are raising funds to cover the cost of his surgery and post-operative care, and every donation\u2014no matter how small\u2014will make a huge difference.\\n\\n[You can read more about lymphoma in guinea pigs here.](../../docs/Guinea%20Pigs/lymphoma)\\n\\n![Boba](boba2.jpeg)\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Boba\u2019s Journey: A True Survivor\\n\\nBoba\u2019s story is one of courage and survival. He\u2019s not just any guinea pig\u2014he\u2019s a warrior who has been through many health challenges over the years. At 7 years old, Boba has already lived a full life, but it hasn\u2019t been without its struggles:\\n\\n\\\\- **Missing an Eyeball**: Boba lost one of his eyes earlier in life, but that never slowed him down. He learned to navigate the world with one eye, always full of curiosity and determination.  \\n    \\n\\\\- **Surviving Bumblefoot**: Boba also battled and beat bumblefoot, a painful condition affecting the feet of guinea pigs. With proper treatment, care, and a lot of love, Boba healed and bounced back stronger than ever.\\n\\nNow, Boba is facing another hurdle: lymphoma. Despite his age and past health issues, Boba\u2019s spirit remains strong, and we believe he deserves every chance to live out his golden years cancer-free.\\n\\n## Why Boba Needs Your Help\\n\\n![Boba\'s tumor](boba.jpeg)\\n\\n\\nBoba\u2019s upcoming surgery is essential to removing the cancerous tumor, but it comes with significant costs, including:\\n\\n\\\\- **Surgical Expenses**: The procedure to remove Boba\u2019s tumor is complex and requires expert veterinary care.  \\n    \\n\\\\- **Post-Operative Care**: After surgery, Boba will need specialized care to ensure a smooth recovery. This includes medications, follow-up vet visits, and supportive care at home.\\n\\nAs a small, volunteer-run animal rescue, we rely on the generosity of our supporters to give guinea pigs like Boba the medical care they need. Every dollar raised will go directly towards covering Boba\u2019s surgery and recovery expenses.\\n\\n## How You Can Help Boba\\n\\nWe are asking for your help to give Boba a fighting chance. Here\u2019s how you can support his surgery and recovery:\\n\\n1\\\\. **Donate**: Every donation, no matter the amount, brings us one step closer to funding Boba\u2019s surgery. Whether it\u2019s $5 or $50, your contribution will make a difference.\\n\\n2\\\\. **Share**: If you\u2019re unable to donate, you can still help by sharing Boba\u2019s story with your friends, family, and social media followers. The more people who know about Boba\u2019s journey, the closer we\u2019ll get to reaching our goal.\\n\\n3\\\\. **Send Love**: Boba may not understand words, but he knows love and kindness. Leave a comment or message of support for Boba to let him know how many people are rooting for him\\\\!\\n\\n## Boba\u2019s Future Depends on You\\n\\nBoba has shown time and again that he\u2019s a survivor, and we believe he can overcome lymphoma with the right medical care. But we can\u2019t do it without your help. Let\u2019s rally together to support this brave little guy and give him the chance to live out his remaining years in comfort and good health.\\n\\nThank you so much for your generosity and compassion.
