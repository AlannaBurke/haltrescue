He\u2019s not just any guinea pig\u2014he\u2019s a warrior who has been through many health challenges over the years. At 7 years old, Boba has already lived a full life, but it hasn\u2019t been without its struggles:\\n\\n\\\\- **Missing an Eyeball**: Boba lost one of his eyes earlier in life, but that never slowed him down. He learned to navigate the world with one eye, always full of curiosity and determination.  \\n    \\n\\\\- **Surviving Bumblefoot**: Boba also battled and beat bumblefoot, a painful condition affecting the feet of guinea pigs. With proper treatment, care, and a lot of love, Boba healed and bounced back stronger than ever.\\n\\nNow, Boba is facing another hurdle: lymphoma.
