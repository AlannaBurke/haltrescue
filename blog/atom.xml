        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have exciting news to share! Helping All Little Pipsqueaks is evolving and will be going back to our original name, Helping All Little Things — an independent rescue dedicated to small animals and sanctuary care. While we are branching out on our own, we want to reassure you that nothing has changed in our friendship with The Pipsqueakery. We’re still great friends and will continue to collaborate! We are so grateful that Alex and the rest of the Pipsqueakery helped us get through these past tumultuous 4 years. Without them, we never would have survived as a rescue.</p>
<p>This transition allows us to focus more closely on what we’re most passionate about: providing specialized care to small animals and offering sanctuary care to those in need. Meanwhile, The Pipsqueakery will continue their outstanding work with wildlife and domestic rescue, a mission we fully support and admire.</p>
<p>We’re proud to announce that Helping All Little Things is officially established as a 501(c)(3) organization in New Hampshire and we will continue to do rescue work along the East Coast.</p>
<p>You can still find us on the same social media platforms, and we hope you’ll continue to follow us and support our work as we embark on this new chapter.</p>
<p>Thank you for being a part of our journey — we couldn’t do it without you, and we’re excited for all the great things to come!</p>
