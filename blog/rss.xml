            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="certified-creeper">Certified Creeper<a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/blog/6-17-mistro#certified-creeper" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Certified Creeper" title="Direct link to Certified Creeper">​</a></h2>
<p>Did you know that in addition to guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits (and pretty much everything else 😂), we also have a certified creeper living at Jen’s house? Don’t worry—he’s the cute kind. 😉</p>
<p>Mistro was born right at Jen’s house on April 21st, 2024—yes, they share a birthday! He was always on the smaller side and had a few respiratory issues early on, so he and his brother ended up becoming permanent residents. A few months ago, Mistro developed a head tilt. We got him checked out and started treatment, but he decided he likes life with a tilt. 😅 It’s fine. Everything’s fine. 🥴</p>
<p>The best part? Mistro doesn’t seem to notice at all—he’s happy, curious, and full of personality. He earned the nickname “the creeper” because he’s always lurking from behind something, just watching with his adorable tilted head. 😆</p>

<p>But let’s be honest: isn’t he the most dashing little creeper you’ve ever seen?</p>

<p>We are so excited to share not one, not two, but three wonderful adoptions today!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-sylvie--checkers">💕 Sylvie &amp; Checkers<a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/blog/6-8-adoptions#-sylvie--checkers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 💕 Sylvie &amp; Checkers" title="Direct link to 💕 Sylvie &amp; Checkers">​</a></h2>
<p>We started the day with the exciting news that Sylvie and Checkers were adopted this morning! Their new family had previously adopted a guinea pig named Frazzle from us, but unfortunately, Frazzle wasn’t getting along with one of their existing piggies.</p>
<p>They decided the best option was to keep Frazzle in her own space and find her a new friend—but when they came to meet Sylvie and Checkers, they just couldn’t choose… so they adopted both! Frazzle now has two new companions, and we couldn’t be happier for all three!</p>

<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Sylvie and Checkers" src="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/assets/images/adoptions2-2f8721bd7c8462e1fb1342ed99ecd5e4.jpg" width="960" height="540" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>⸻</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-challah">🥖 Challah<a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/blog/6-8-adoptions#-challah" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🥖 Challah" title="Direct link to 🥖 Challah">​</a></h2>
<p>Challah also found her forever home today! She went home with one of our previous adopters, and as you can see, she’s already fitting in beautifully with their group. She even matches the theme and looks like she’s always belonged. We’re so thrilled to see her thriving already!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Challah" src="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/assets/images/adoptions3-6c2bb72d2acb3bb2b098bc7e55a6db6b.jpg" width="960" height="541" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>And to round out this amazing day—Fortune has been adopted! This very handsome boy went home to a lovely family, including a senior guinea pig and an owner who happens to be a veterinarian! The plan is to have Fortune neutered and eventually start a small herd of females once their senior pig passes. We’re absolutely overjoyed knowing he’s in such knowledgeable and loving hands.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Fortune" src="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/assets/images/adoptions4-7b40144d7e59abd4d9542619ce700417.jpg" width="540" height="675" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>It’s been a fantastic day for adoptions, and we are so grateful to our adopters, fosters, and supporters who make happy endings like these possible. 🥰 Stay tuned for more updates as we continue finding loving homes for these amazing little lives! 💛</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-saying-goodbye-to-preston-">💔 Saying Goodbye to Preston 🌈<a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/blog/6-7-Preston#-saying-goodbye-to-preston-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 💔 Saying Goodbye to Preston 🌈" title="Direct link to 💔 Saying Goodbye to Preston 🌈">​</a></h2>
<p>We are absolutely heartbroken to share that we’ll be bringing Preston in for humane euthanasia this afternoon.</p>
<p>Around 3 AM, Preston suffered what appeared to be a neurological event. We were hoping it might be inner ear-related and started antibiotics right away, but sadly, there’s been no improvement. We can’t let him suffer, and this is the most compassionate option we have left.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-about-preston">🐹 About Preston<a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/blog/6-7-Preston#-about-preston" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🐹 About Preston" title="Direct link to 🐹 About Preston">​</a></h2>
<p>Preston came to us from the NHSPCA after being rescued from a hoarding situation. His previous owner had passed away, so we had very little background on his age or condition.</p>
<p>He was a sweet but shy boy who found comfort in his best friend, Sherlock. Letting him go is breaking our hearts.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-cost-136">💸 Cost: $136<a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/blog/6-7-Preston#-cost-136" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 💸 Cost: $136" title="Direct link to 💸 Cost: $136">​</a></h2>
<p>This loss was completely unexpected. If anyone is able to sponsor or co-sponsor Preston’s euthanasia, it would mean the world to us. Even small contributions help in moments like this.</p>

<p>Great news—Novel and Coralie’s medications have been fully sponsored! 💖 Thank you so much to everyone who helped make that happen!</p>

<p>Haiku has been struggling with some ongoing health concerns, and we’re scheduled to do bloodwork at her next appointment:</p>
<p>📅 Appointment Date: Tuesday, June 11th at 3 PM<br>
<!-- -->💰 Estimated Cost: ~$350<br>
<!-- -->(Includes the cost of light sedation, since she was very uncooperative at her last visit.)</p>
<p>If she doesn’t wind up needing sedation, any leftover funds will go directly toward another one of our special-needs critters.</p>

<p>Our “babies” aren’t babies anymore—Saga, Fantasy, Madrigal, Gothic, and Rhyme have officially graduated and joined the adult herd! These girls are now around 6–7 months old, and while we’ll always think of them as our little ones, they’re growing up beautifully.</p>
<p>Their move into the adult cage made space for a new special group…</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-introducing-team-wonkiest-females">💫 Introducing: Team Wonkiest Females<a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/blog/6-6-babies#-introducing-team-wonkiest-females" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 💫 Introducing: Team Wonkiest Females" title="Direct link to 💫 Introducing: Team Wonkiest Females">​</a></h2>
<p>With their old cage freed up, we created a cozy setup for Team Wonkiest Females—a crew of our beloved ladies who need a little extra care and monitoring:</p>
<p>Haiku, Brynlee, Blakely, Memoir, and Coralie.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="️-eating-update">🍽️ Eating Update!<a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/blog/6-6-babies#%EF%B8%8F-eating-update" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🍽️ Eating Update!" title="Direct link to 🍽️ Eating Update!">​</a></h2>
<p>The good news keeps coming—Coralie and Memoir are back to eating on their own, thanks to a solid pain management routine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Novel is still our most hand-fed piggy right now, but he’s making slow progress.</li>
<li>Caper gets a little handfeeding too… but honestly? That’s more because he’s spoiled and likes the attention. 😄</li>
</ul>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>We’re celebrating the little wins every day—whether it’s a piggie eating on their own again, or a herd shuffle that just works. Thank you for supporting us as we care for these incredible little lives. 🐹💕</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-danni-casanova--cupid-check-in-">🐹 Danni, Casanova &amp; Cupid Check In! 💌<a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/blog/6-5-adoptables#-danni-casanova--cupid-check-in-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🐹 Danni, Casanova &amp; Cupid Check In! 💌" title="Direct link to 🐹 Danni, Casanova &amp; Cupid Check In! 💌">​</a></h2>
<p>Danni, Casanova, and Cupid are checking in from their wonderful foster home—and these handsome boys are doing great!</p>
<p>Casanova and Cupid met by chance and headed off to foster together. While Casanova was a bit of a drama starter at first (aren’t all the best leading men?), things have really smoothed out. There are still the occasional kerfuffles when everyone gets the zoomies and crashes into each other, but now that they’ve settled in, their personalities are really starting to shine.</p>
<p>These boys came to us from the Woodbridge guinea pig group and were pretty beat up when they arrived.</p>
<p>💫 Danni has been with us since he was just 3 weeks old—his birthday is April 21st!—and he’s been patiently waiting for his forever home ever since.</p>
<p>Now that they’ve bonded into a sweet trio (especially Danni and Cupid, who are clearly besties), we’re looking to adopt them out together. And let’s be honest…</p>
<p>Three guinea pigs are better than one. 😉💕</p>
<p>If you’re ready to add some charm, cuddles, and zoomie chaos to your life, these boys are ready to go home!</p>
<p>📩 Apply to adopt via our Petfinder or website today!</p>

<p>Currently sitting in my car, kind of dreading walking into my house. Between the disaster zone that is my living room and the stack of things I need to do—on top of handfeeding multiple piggies—I’m feeling more than a little twitchy. But anyway… here’s today’s vet report!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-sherlock">🦷 Sherlock<a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/blog/6-4-nh-update#-sherlock" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🦷 Sherlock" title="Direct link to 🦷 Sherlock">​</a></h2>
<p>Sherlock was an absolute champ. He even ate Oxbow pellets after waking up from surgery—this blew my mind, because at home, if I offer him Oxbow, he dumps the bowl and pees in it out of spite.</p>
<p>He has a recheck in a month to see how soon we’ll need to schedule the next dental. Oh, and fun fact? He has a bonus rogue tooth growing in a totally inappropriate location. Honestly, that tracks. Of course the animal living in my house has an extra, chaotic tooth.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-a-fun-surprise">🐹 A Fun Surprise!<a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/blog/6-4-nh-update#-a-fun-surprise" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🐹 A Fun Surprise!" title="Direct link to 🐹 A Fun Surprise!">​</a></h2>
<p>I finally got to meet Betsy from Wheektopia Rescue in person today at Dr. Ford’s office! I recommended Southern Maine to her a while back, and she loved them so much she made them her primary vet too.</p>
<p>It was so nice to meet another fellow crazy guinea pig person in real life—and yes, I got to smooch some of the adorable pigs she brought in for exams. Check out this massive mama-to-be! I had to head out before her ultrasound, but I’ll be texting Betsy later to see how many babies are packed in there.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-poor-coralie">😔 Poor Coralie<a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/blog/6-4-nh-update#-poor-coralie" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 😔 Poor Coralie" title="Direct link to 😔 Poor Coralie">​</a></h2>
<p>In not-so-great news: Coralie has very advanced osteodystrophy in her jaw, and it’s incredibly worn down. Honestly, I don’t know how she hid it for so long—girl can EAT.</p>
<p>She also has significant bone wear around her knees. While I often use “Satin Syndrome” as a general term, osteodystrophy specifically refers to when the body stops absorbing calcium properly, causing the bones to erode or break down. Satin Syndrome is more of a catch-all term for the various issues that satins can face.</p>
<p>Looking into her mouth, you’ll see red sores—not because of bad teeth (hers are actually great), but likely from chewing awkwardly to avoid jaw pain.</p>
<p>Coralie and Novel will now be on stronger pain meds 2x/day, compared to the other satins, who are doing well on once-daily higher-dose Metacam.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="️-housing-shuffle-incoming">🏗️ Housing Shuffle Incoming<a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/blog/6-4-nh-update#%EF%B8%8F-housing-shuffle-incoming" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🏗️ Housing Shuffle Incoming" title="Direct link to 🏗️ Housing Shuffle Incoming">​</a></h2>
<p>I’m tinkering with the idea of grouping the satin girls together in one cage to reduce food competition and give them a more consistent care setup.</p>
<p>I’m also considering moving Haiku, Kavita, Brynlee, and Blakely into their own setup since Haiku and Brynlee have kidney issues, and I’d like to try them on 100% Timothy pellets.</p>
<p>So yes… it’s going to be a very long weekend of playing musical guinea pigs. 🙃</p>

<p>We really need to take some updated glamour shots of Sherlock, because this brave boy made it through dental surgery like a champ! 💪</p>
<p>As expected, his teeth were a complete mess—including a random spare tooth just hanging out where it didn’t belong. We’re likely looking at dental surgeries every 6 weeks to keep him healthy and comfortable.</p>

<p>Last night during veggie time, Coralie (one of our beautiful satin girls) refused her peppers—her absolute favorite. That’s a big red flag.</p>
<p>She’s heading to the vet at 3 PM today, and we’re anticipating about $150 for her exam and X-rays to check for Satin Syndrome.</p>

<p>Both Parody and Novel had a really positive response to the addition of Buprenex to their pain management plans!</p>
<p>Last night, Novel was eating celery on his own, and this afternoon, Parody munched on some pellets and veggies without help. It’s clear the medication helped—but just as clear when it wears off. Since Buprenex is a controlled substance, vets have to be careful with how they prescribe it. We were given just one dose each to test their response.</p>
<p>Now that we know it helps, we should be able to get a bit more at a time—but I expect I’ll still need to make regular trips to the vet to pick it up. (Not a problem—I’m there at least once a week anyway!)</p>

<p>I also took a chance and moved Parody into the couch cage, and so far he’s doing great! He’s very calm and seems completely smitten with Hero. Honestly, the babies really seem to lift everyone’s spirits—mine included.</p>
<p>And even as a lifelong crazy guinea pig lady, I never thought I’d be the kind of person with a couch cage…
But here we are. 💁‍♀️🐹💕</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="haiku">Haiku<a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/blog/haiku#haiku" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Haiku" title="Direct link to Haiku">​</a></h3>
<p>Haiku’s urinalysis results just came back and showed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very low specific gravity, and</li>
<li>Crystals in her urine</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a first for us—we’ve never had a piggy with crystals before—but in theory, it should be manageable. Everyone here is already on a fairly low-calcium diet, but we’ll be separating Haiku from the herd temporarily and adjusting her diet to an even more kidney-friendly plan.</p>
<p>Given how underweight she was at intake, we suspect this issue started long before she arrived at the rescue.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-whats-next">🧪 What’s Next?<a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/blog/haiku#-whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🧪 What’s Next?" title="Direct link to 🧪 What’s Next?">​</a></h3>
<p>We’d like to do bloodwork to rule out or confirm kidney disease or hyperthyroidism—both of which could explain her weight loss despite a healthy appetite.</p>
<p>Hyperthyroidism can impact kidney function, but it’s also very manageable with a proper diagnosis. We need confirmation to move forward with the right treatment plan.</p>
<p>There’s a chance we may need to lightly sedate her for the blood draw since she was extremely uncooperative at her last exam. We’ll be at the vet tomorrow for Sherlock’s dental, and we’re hoping to get her bloodwork done then if we can raise the funds in time.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>💸 Here’s What We Need Help Covering</p>
<ul>
<li>🐱 Rabies boosters for sanctuary cats (due to bat exposure)	$250</li>
<li>🐹 Novel &amp; Parody’s vet visit $208</li>
<li>🐹 Sherlock, Haiku, Kavita, Caper, Rhyme &amp; Memoir’s visit (6/5)	$358</li>
<li>🦷 Sherlock’s dental surgery (6/6)	$350</li>
<li>🧪 Haiku’s bloodwork (incl. potential sedation)	$350</li>
</ul>
<p>🆘 Total Needed: <strong>$1,516</strong></p>
<p>If we don’t end up needing the full amount for Haiku’s bloodwork, the remaining funds will roll over to cover other vet bills, as we’re absolutely drowning in medical costs right now. Every dollar helps. Every share helps.</p>

<p>📢 Please have a seat—this won’t take long, but it is a mandatory meeting.</p>
<p>Susan from Marketing and Carol from HR have prepared a brief presentation on why you need business pigs in your life—and how they can help you solve all your productivity problems!</p>
<p>There will be a PowerPoint presentation (because would it even be a real business meeting without one?).</p>
<p>Susan from Marketing will be leading the bulk of today’s session. She and Carol firmly believe that every home needs business guinea pigs. What do they bring to the table?
•	First, they’re excellent at keeping everyone on schedule. They know when it’s veggie time and will politely remind you—by screaming into the void—if you’re even a minute late.
•	They’re highly motivating. Who wouldn’t want to work harder for these tiny, adorable faces?
•	They bring structured fun to the workplace—think of it as business-appropriate enrichment. Maybe a veggie party at lunch to boost team morale?</p>
<p>Now, let’s address logistics. Susan and Carol are a bonded pair and must stay together. They’re a dynamic duo, and let’s be honest: two business pigs are always better than one.</p>
<p>While they believe everyone could benefit from business pigs in their lives, they are the only ones currently looking to transfer offices. So don’t miss your chance—submit your hiring packets soon!</p>
<p>📩 That concludes today’s presentation. Susan and Carol are happy to take questions, but if you’re already sold, applications can be found on our Petfinder!</p>
<p>Bonus: They’d be thrilled to join an existing team of business pigs, if you’ve already got an established office looking for fresh talent.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today was a very busy day at the vet. Thankfully, nothing was outright terrible—but we did learn some surprising things about a few of our little ones. Here’s a full update!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-sherlock-the-chinchilla">🐭 Sherlock the Chinchilla<a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/blog/6-2-25-nh-update#-sherlock-the-chinchilla" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🐭 Sherlock the Chinchilla" title="Direct link to 🐭 Sherlock the Chinchilla">​</a></h3>
<p>No surprise here—Sherlock needs a dental surgery, which is scheduled for Wednesday. We absolutely need help covering the cost of this procedure. Donations, shares, and good vibes are all deeply appreciated.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-caper">🐹 Caper<a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/blog/6-2-25-nh-update#-caper" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🐹 Caper" title="Direct link to 🐹 Caper">​</a></h3>
<p>Caper came in for a recheck. I just wanted to be absolutely sure that his drooling was from having no incisors (rather than bad molars). His molars look fantastic!</p>
<p>Caper is actually the first small animal I’ve had with zero incisors—I’ve seen many missing one or two, but not all four. He’s growing slowly and is much smaller than his brother, and may just be a tiny guy for life.</p>
<p>Sadly, based on past experience, very stunted pigs often have shorter life spans due to poor genetics. I knew this going in, but it doesn’t make it any easier. These babies have my whole heart, and when their time comes, I will not be okay.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-kavita">🐹 Kavita<a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/blog/6-2-25-nh-update#-kavita" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🐹 Kavita" title="Direct link to 🐹 Kavita">​</a></h3>
<p>Kavita got her second hormone injection today, and it’s already helping! Her hair is growing back and the ovarian cysts have shrunk significantly after just one dose. We’re hopeful this second round will resolve things completely.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-haiku">🐹 Haiku<a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/blog/6-2-25-nh-update#-haiku" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🐹 Haiku" title="Direct link to 🐹 Haiku">​</a></h3>
<p>Haiku was meant to be seen just for a heart check, but she was very painful and grumpy with the tech and Dr. Ford—very unlike her.</p>
<p>She’s been eating well and has great poops, but has lost weight. We were discussing possible arthritis and other ideas when she urinated on the table—and all three of us noticed how diluted her urine looked.</p>
<p>We took a sample and sent it for testing. Kidney issues would explain the weight loss… and while her heart sounded good today, possible kidney disease is deeply concerning.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-rhyme-mother-of-the-lethals">🐹 Rhyme (Mother of the Lethals)<a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/blog/6-2-25-nh-update#-rhyme-mother-of-the-lethals" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🐹 Rhyme (Mother of the Lethals)" title="Direct link to 🐹 Rhyme (Mother of the Lethals)">​</a></h3>
<p>I brought Rhyme in to confirm that she wasn’t pregnant again (she’s not). During the ultrasound, however, we discovered that her colon has adhered to her bladder—a not-uncommon result of pregnancy and birth.</p>
<p>There’s nothing to be done now, but it’s critical information in case she ever needs abdominal surgery.</p>
<p>We also saw that her bladder looked inflamed, even though she has no UTI symptoms. She’s starting a round of antibiotics and we’ll recheck her soon.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-memoir">🐹 Memoir<a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/blog/6-2-25-nh-update#-memoir" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🐹 Memoir" title="Direct link to 🐹 Memoir">​</a></h3>
<p>Memoir is a stunning satin girl who arrived just under a month ago. At intake, she was bunny hopping, which usually indicates arthritis or osteodystrophy.</p>
<p>Her X-rays didn’t show any bone loss at that time, so we started her on a low-dose pain med. Unfortunately, her pain is already increasing—a sign that Satin Syndrome may be progressing.</p>
<p>We’re increasing her dose of Metacam and hoping it will bring her some much-needed comfort. Satin Syndrome is heartbreaking and can advance so quickly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have some sad news, but also some cautiously hopeful updates to share.</p>
<p>💔 First, the heartbreaking part:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="kerrigan">Kerrigan<a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/blog/6-1-25-nh-update#kerrigan" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Kerrigan" title="Direct link to Kerrigan">​</a></h3>
<p>Our sweet Kerrigan, who had been living with congestive heart failure, passed away peacefully this morning. Kerrigan was born in the rescue on May 27, 2020, and was adopted as a baby before returning to us last June. I had a feeling she belonged with us, so she joined our large female herd, where she was surrounded by friends and love.</p>
<p>Not long after her return, she was diagnosed with CHF. With Lasix and Pimobendan, we were able to manage her condition for quite a while. Kerrigan was a happy, affectionate girl who adored her herd and the extra cuddles she got during medication time. She’s now reunited with her sister—hopefully popcorning together over the rainbow bridge. 💕</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="novel-and-parody">Novel and Parody<a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/blog/6-1-25-nh-update#novel-and-parody" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Novel and Parody" title="Direct link to Novel and Parody">​</a></h3>
<p>🌱 Now for some cautiously good news:
The round-the-clock care over the past few weeks has been exhausting—but it’s starting to feel worth it. Our lethal babies are thriving, and both Novel and Parody seem to have turned a corner.</p>
<p>✨ Novel is now holding himself upright instead of lying flat and floppy. Truthfully, I’ve never had success bringing back an animal once they’ve reached that point—but Novel is alert, interested in food, has started urinating, and even let out a little protest during his last sub-q fluids. These are all wonderful signs.</p>
<p>✨ Parody is full of curiosity and taking food like a champ. His poops are well-formed—still not quite as much as we’d like, but any output right now is a win.</p>
<p>After days of being glued to their sides, terrified to step away, I finally feel like I can breathe a bit. I may even take a shower and grab some fresh veggies for the crew. (I also need to get my second rabies shot after that bat incident, but that’s another story…)</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="boba-update">Boba Update!<a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/blog/boba#boba-update" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Boba Update!" title="Direct link to Boba Update!">​</a></h2>
<p>On October 10, Boba had his surgery at Southern Maine Hospital for Small Mammals, and it was a big success! The tumor was removed with excellent margins, and Boba came through surgery perfectly, eating and pooping as soon as he woke up. The incision is so small and clean, and we're so grateful to Dr Ford for his excellent work! Boba will be recovering with some pain meds for a few days, but we expect him to be back to normal ASAP.</p>

<h1>Fundraiser for Boba: Help Our Brave Guinea Pig Fight Lymphoma</h1>
<p>Meet Boba, a remarkable 7-year-old guinea pig with a heart full of resilience and the spirit of a fighter. Boba has faced more than his fair share of challenges in his life, but he never gave up—and now, he needs our help to overcome his toughest battle yet. Boba has been diagnosed with lymphoma, and he’s scheduled to undergo surgery to remove a cancerous tumor. We are raising funds to cover the cost of his surgery and post-operative care, and every donation—no matter how small—will make a huge difference.</p>
<p><a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/docs/Guinea%20Pigs/lymphoma">You can read more about lymphoma in guinea pigs here.</a></p>

<p>Boba’s story is one of courage and survival. He’s not just any guinea pig—he’s a warrior who has been through many health challenges over the years. At 7 years old, Boba has already lived a full life, but it hasn’t been without its struggles:</p>
<p>- <strong>Missing an Eyeball</strong>: Boba lost one of his eyes earlier in life, but that never slowed him down. He learned to navigate the world with one eye, always full of curiosity and determination.</p>
<p>- <strong>Surviving Bumblefoot</strong>: Boba also battled and beat bumblefoot, a painful condition affecting the feet of guinea pigs. With proper treatment, care, and a lot of love, Boba healed and bounced back stronger than ever.</p>
<p>Now, Boba is facing another hurdle: lymphoma. Despite his age and past health issues, Boba’s spirit remains strong, and we believe he deserves every chance to live out his golden years cancer-free.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-boba-needs-your-help">Why Boba Needs Your Help<a href="https://helpingalllittlethings.org/blog/boba#why-boba-needs-your-help" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Boba Needs Your Help" title="Direct link to Why Boba Needs Your Help">​</a></h2>

<p>Boba’s upcoming surgery is essential to removing the cancerous tumor, but it comes with significant costs, including:</p>
<p>- <strong>Surgical Expenses</strong>: The procedure to remove Boba’s tumor is complex and requires expert veterinary care.</p>
<p>- <strong>Post-Operative Care</strong>: After surgery, Boba will need specialized care to ensure a smooth recovery. This includes medications, follow-up vet visits, and supportive care at home.</p>
<p>As a small, volunteer-run animal rescue, we rely on the generosity of our supporters to give guinea pigs like Boba the medical care they need. Every dollar raised will go directly towards covering Boba’s surgery and recovery expenses.</p>

<p>We are asking for your help to give Boba a fighting chance. Here’s how you can support his surgery and recovery:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Donate</strong>: Every donation, no matter the amount, brings us one step closer to funding Boba’s surgery. Whether it’s $5 or $50, your contribution will make a difference.</p>

<p>Boba has shown time and again that he’s a survivor, and we believe he can overcome lymphoma with the right medical care. But we can’t do it without your help. Let’s rally together to support this brave little guy and give him the chance to live out his remaining years in comfort and good health.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your generosity and compassion. Boba may be missing an eye, but he’s never lost his sight for the love and support around him. Together, we can help Boba fight this cancer and continue to live his best life.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have exciting news to share! Helping All Little Pipsqueaks is evolving and will be going back to our original name, Helping All Little Things — an independent rescue dedicated to small animals and sanctuary care. While we are branching out on our own, we want to reassure you that nothing has changed in our friendship with The Pipsqueakery. We’re still great friends and will continue to collaborate! We are so grateful that Alex and the rest of the Pipsqueakery helped us get through these past tumultuous 4 years. Without them, we never would have survived as a rescue.</p>
<p>This transition allows us to focus more closely on what we’re most passionate about: providing specialized care to small animals and offering sanctuary care to those in need. Meanwhile, The Pipsqueakery will continue their outstanding work with wildlife and domestic rescue, a mission we fully support and admire.</p>
<p>We’re proud to announce that Helping All Little Things is officially established as a 501(c)(3) organization in New Hampshire and we will continue to do rescue work along the East Coast.</p>
<p>You can still find us on the same social media platforms, and we hope you’ll continue to follow us and support our work as we embark on this new chapter.</p>
<p>Thank you for being a part of our journey — we couldn’t do it without you, and we’re excited for all the great things to come!</p>
